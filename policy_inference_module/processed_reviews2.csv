There is literally no way for me to book lessons from my own team, and according to the website, even if I managed to book lessons from other teams, they don't count toward my progress (since I alr opt for one team system).

The limit is 6 lessons/month and even that took me almost 2 hours to book 6 slots on 13th June.

Resorts World Sentosa Casino,"Our recent visit to the Casino at Sentosa was deeply disappointing. As tourists, we were denied entry simply because we were not carrying our original passports. Despite offering to show digital copies alongside our national ID cards (from our country of residence), the staff were adamant about requiring only original passports, with no exceptions.

What made the situation even more frustrating was the lack of clear communicationânowhere on the official website, booking platforms, or tourist information was it explicitly mentioned that original passports are mandatory for entry. This oversight is highly inconvenient for tourists who may not carry their passports at all times, especially when visiting an island destination like Sentosa.

To make matters worse, a staff member in a light blue shirt was particularly rude and dismissive. He failed to explain the policy properly, refused to listen, and left us feeling unwelcome and unheard.

Suggestion: Please make the passport requirement highly visible and clearly communicated across all relevant platforms, including at entry points, websites, and brochures. Itâs unreasonable to expect tourists to return all the way to their hotel just to retrieve a document that could easily be verified with a secure digital or ID backup.

United Square Shopping Mall,"I am writing to formally raise an issue that I would like to address regarding the layout of the shopping mall. On 4th July, I had just picked up my son from his class which is located at level 3. As I always bring a stroller, it is clear that using the escalator is not an option, nor is the public lift as it does not have access to level 3. Instead, I had to opt for the cargo lift. However, a cleaner told me that the cargo lift was not for shoppers and had to use the fire lift. I believe that he is being very reasonable and has not nothing wrong but to comply with the management's requirements. Unfortunately, the problem with the fire lift was that it stops at every floor-- meaning that I would have to wait at least 20 minutes for it to come down from level 32  and by the time it reaches level 3, it would be extremely crowded. Luckily, I managed to squeeze in with my stroller while the other users had to make space.

On a side note, sometimes, I would not be able to use the fire lift as it would be too crowded for me to enter. I've also tried to take the escalator instead by folding the stroller but security would still say that it is unsafe. I find it unpleasant that such areas are only accessible for those who drive while others are left to ""figure it out on their own"". I myself cannot drive and hence, it becomes a hassle to send my son for his classes.

This current arrangement falls short of meeting the needs of convenience for shoppers which can turn a happy shopping experience into a stressful one. Alternatively, I am perfectly fine with using the cargo lift as it is easy and efficient.

However, a cleaner told me that the cargo lift was not for shoppers and had to use the fire lift.

Thank you for sharing your feedback, and please accept our sincerest apologies for the experience you and your friends encountered.

We understand how concerning it must have been to find a stain on the bedsheet, and we truly regret that this situation caused such discomfort. Cleanliness and hygiene are top priorities for us, and we take such matters very seriously. Our housekeeping protocols are in place to prevent such incidents, and we are reviewing this matter internally to ensure it does not happen again.

Upon being informed, our team responded immediately and offered a room change as a form of service recovery. However, we understand that your friends chose to check out instead. As the reservation was made for two nights and our team did offer an alternative roomâwhich was declinedâwe regret that we are unable to process a refund.

We genuinely value your feedback, as it helps us improve. Should you choose to stay with us again, we hope to have the opportunity to provide you with a much better experience.

Best regards,
Marsya

There is a place for a feed when youâre famished and they do great satay which are cooked as you order. Lots of photo opportunities and you get to buy them on your way out. The rides will be suspended when there is a lightning warning but will reopen quickly once itâs lifted. Category: Water park","1) Water Park

Alexandra Hospital,"I was recently warded at Alexandra Hospital, Block 7, Level 2, Ward 10 for a prolonged fever, and I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation for the outstanding care I received.

Although it was a B2 subsidised ward, it didnât feel like one at all. We had a great level of privacy, and the environment felt more like a private ward, which was a pleasant surprise.

The staff nurses and doctors on duty throughout the night, morning, and afternoon shifts on the 5th and 6th of April were exceptional. They were caring, professional, sweet, and friendly. The service was fast, efficient, and top notch. I was genuinely impressed by how attentive and responsive everyone was.

Even the food exceeded my expectations especially the Indian meals, which were delicious and comforting.

It was truly a comfortable and reassuring hospital stay. The team attended to my needs quickly and thoroughly, unlike what Iâve experienced in some other well-known hospitals.

It's a 20-30min drive from the city, and it's not far from the PIE exit. Changi Airport & Jewel are just a short 15-min drive.

ARFC East Coast Park,"Cafe Football has always been my regular hangout spot, it truly feels like home. I used to visit the Woodleigh outlet often and even now I donât mind travelling all the way to the East coast park branch just to enjoy the same great vibes.

BLACKGOAT,"HATS OFF TO THE TEAM!

We arrived at 5.35pm but had to queue 1 hourâ¦ But worth the wait. Amazing food.

Iâd like to highlight some staff in particular â the two front-of-house fellas (one twenty-year-old with braces, and another with a bucket hat) were so friendly, and their service was so good! They took the time to change our plates and utensils for our desserts AND explain the desserts to us (whatâs in it, how to eat). Michelin-level service in a hawker centre.

The guy on the grill was also impressive, picking up the steaks with his (gloved but essentially bare) hands. Not hot ah?! I see you and your efforts sir.

We chatted briefly with the bucket hat fella and learnt that the team washes ALL THEIR DISHES by themselves, to make sure that itâs cleaned up to their standards for their customers. This is a small, probably always overlooked, yet important detail that just goes to show how much they care, and how proud they are of their food. Bravo to these young folks!",FALSE,TRUE,"Thank you For The Compliments, and I apologize for the long wait.

And I Am Very Glad You Enjoyed your Meal, and that it was worth it. 

The guys are Bilaal (With Braces) And Gab (With Bucket Hat)

Bilaal Is Starting University soon and this is literally his first Job after National service and has had no experience anywhere else. He works with his heart, intelligence and heâs great - everything he does is through his sincerity. Weâre very lucky to have him.  

Gabriel is our Front Of House Manager (Of Some Sort, we donât use these formalities too much but he is) - and heâs the best - prior to this heâs only had one other Job at a famous bagel place, and he produces music as his passion. Heâs really great, very empathetic, very easy going, and very friendly. He always intends to make people feel comfortable, and heâs always down for a chat (sometimes always too much down haha)

Theyâre great, they work with their hearts - and Iâm glad that you saw that. I think thereâs nothing more I can ask for honestly from them.

We are working very hard to improve the FOH and service side to Blackgoat, and we endeavour to offer a sincere, understanding, honest, kind and considerate service - through our own eyes, our own way. We will go the mile to make you feel comfortable and happy.

We hope to see you again! 

Best Regards

(PS; In my mind - as I have trained my hands - I rather bear the heat so that I can go faster and better, and get more perfect steaks; than even think about the pain I get from holding the hot steaks - physical pain is nothing - all of this, for my lovely, very supportive guests.

Bones 'n Barrels Sentosa,"ð 5-Star Review ð
We recently celebrated my Dadâs 68th birthday at Bones & Barrels, VivoCity and it was truly an unforgettable experience. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel welcome and cared for. But what truly stood out was the incredible effort from the chef, Mukesh Bhagat who went above and beyond to prepare jain delicacies for my parents.

Every bite was a reflection of the chefâs creativity, attention to detail, and genuine passion for food. It felt like more than just a mealâit was a heartfelt experience that brought joy to our entire family.

Our parents were deeply touched by the thoughtful touches, from providing complimentary ice cream and French Fries to putting on special bday music for my dad.  Weâre so grateful to the entire team at Bones & Barrels, especially Chef Mukesh Bhagat, for making this celebration so special.

Every bite was a reflection of the chefâs creativity, attention to detail, and genuine passion for food. It felt like more than just a mealâit was a heartfelt experience that brought joy to our entire family.

Our parents were deeply touched by the thoughtful touches, from providing complimentary ice cream and French Fries to putting on special bday music for my dad.  Weâre so grateful to the entire team at Bones & Barrels, especially Chef Mukesh Bhagat, for making this celebration so special.

CDC Driving Centre (Ubi),"I recently completed my driving lessons with Mr Sim (0717) and Mr Arthur Lee (0740) from CDC Ubi (Elite Team 1) and I couldn't be more satisfied with the experience! From the very first lesson, Mr Sim made me feel comfortable and confident behind the wheel. Their calm demeanor and patient teaching style helped me overcome my initial nervousness.

The lessons were well-structured, covering everything from basic maneuvers to more complex driving scenarios. They provided valuable feedback that helped me improve quickly while also boosting my confidence.
