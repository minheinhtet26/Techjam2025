'''
You are a review summarizer. Your task is to read a user review and generate a short, concise summary that captures the main points and meaning without losing important details. Use clear and simple language. Keep the summary brief, ideally one or two sentences. Do not add opinions or extra information not present in the review.
'''

# Parse all links as <link>

'''
Sentiment intensity (e.g., mild vs. extreme complaints)

Tone/style (promotional, sarcastic, informative)

Entity relevance (does it mention products/services in policy?)


ðŸ”¹ How SpaCy helps

SpaCy
 is a Python library with built-in NER models (like en_core_web_sm = small English model, en_core_web_trf = larger transformer model).
You can load it and run NER on text:

import spacy

# Load small English model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

text = "I ordered a Big Mac at McDonaldâ€™s in Singapore."
doc = nlp(text)

for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
