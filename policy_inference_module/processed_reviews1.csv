Resorts World Sentosa Casino,"Our recent visit to the Casino at Sentosa was deeply disappointing. As tourists, we were denied entry simply because we were not carrying our original passports. Despite offering to show digital copies alongside our national ID cards (from our country of residence), the staff were adamant about requiring only original passports, with no exceptions.

United Square Shopping Mall,"I am writing to formally raise an issue that I would like to address regarding the layout of the shopping mall. On 4th July, I had just picked up my son from his class which is located at level 3. As I always bring a stroller, it is clear that using the escalator is not an option, nor is the public lift as it does not have access to level 3. Instead, I had to opt for the cargo lift. However, a cleaner told me that the cargo lift was not for shoppers and had to use the fire lift. I believe that he is being very reasonable and has not nothing wrong but to comply with the management's requirements. Unfortunately, the problem with the fire lift was that it stops at every floor-- meaning that I would have to wait at least 20 minutes for it to come down from level 32  and by the time it reaches level 3, it would be extremely crowded. Luckily, I managed to squeeze in with my stroller while the other users had to make space.

On a side note, sometimes, I would not be able to use the fire lift as it would be too crowded for me to enter. I've also tried to take the escalator instead by folding the stroller but security would still say that it is unsafe. I find it unpleasant that such areas are only accessible for those who drive while others are left to ""figure it out on their own"". I myself cannot drive and hence, it becomes a hassle to send my son for his classes.

This current arrangement falls short of meeting the needs of convenience for shoppers which can turn a happy shopping experience into a stressful one. Alternatively, I am perfectly fine with using the cargo lift as it is easy and efficient.  I urge you to review this outlay and take meaningful steps to improve lift access across the shopping centre by strategically placing lifts to reduce congestion.

Thank you for sharing your feedback, and please accept our sincerest apologies for the experience you and your friends encountered.

We understand how concerning it must have been to find a stain on the bedsheet, and we truly regret that this situation caused such discomfort. Cleanliness and hygiene are top priorities for us, and we take such matters very seriously. Our housekeeping protocols are in place to prevent such incidents, and we are reviewing this matter internally to ensure it does not happen again.

Upon being informed, our team responded immediately and offered a room change as a form of service recovery. However, we understand that your friends chose to check out instead. As the reservation was made for two nights and our team did offer an alternative roomâwhich was declinedâwe regret that we are unable to process a refund.

We genuinely value your feedback, as it helps us improve. Should you choose to stay with us again, we hope to have the opportunity to provide you with a much better experience.

Best regards,

BLACKGOAT,"HATS OFF TO THE TEAM!

We arrived at 5.35pm but had to queue 1 hourâ¦ But worth the wait. Amazing food.

Iâd like to highlight some staff in particular â the two front-of-house fellas (one twenty-year-old with braces, and another with a bucket hat) were so friendly, and their service was so good! They took the time to change our plates and utensils for our desserts AND explain the desserts to us (whatâs in it, how to eat). Michelin-level service in a hawker centre.

The guy on the grill was also impressive, picking up the steaks with his (gloved but essentially bare) hands. Not hot ah?! I see you and your efforts sir.

We chatted briefly with the bucket hat fella and learnt that the team washes ALL THEIR DISHES by themselves, to make sure that itâs cleaned up to their standards for their customers. This is a small, probably always overlooked, yet important detail that just goes to show how much they care, and how proud they are of their food. Bravo to these young folks!",False,True,"Thank you For The Compliments, and I apologize for the long wait.

And I Am Very Glad You Enjoyed your Meal, and that it was worth it. 

The guys are Bilaal (With Braces) And Gab (With Bucket Hat)

Bilaal Is Starting University soon and this is literally his first Job after National service and has had no experience anywhere else. He works with his heart, intelligence and heâs great - everything he does is through his sincerity. Weâre very lucky to have him.  

Gabriel is our Front Of House Manager (Of Some Sort, we donât use these formalities too much but he is) - and heâs the best - prior to this heâs only had one other Job at a famous bagel place, and he produces music as his passion. Heâs really great, very empathetic, very easy going, and very friendly. He always intends to make people feel comfortable, and heâs always down for a chat (sometimes always too much down haha)

Theyâre great, they work with their hearts - and Iâm glad that you saw that. I think thereâs nothing more I can ask for honestly from them.

We are working very hard to improve the FOH and service side to Blackgoat, and we endeavour to offer a sincere, understanding, honest, kind and considerate service - through our own eyes, our own way. We will go the mile to make you feel comfortable and happy.

We hope to see you again! 

Best Regards

Fikri

(PS; In my mind - as I have trained my hands - I rather bear the heat so that I can go faster and better, and get more perfect steaks; than even think about the pain I get from holding the hot steaks - physical pain is nothing - all of this, for my lovely, very supportive guests.

Bones 'n Barrels Sentosa,"ð 5-Star Review ð

But what truly stood out was the incredible effort from the chef, Mukesh Bhagat who went above and beyond to prepare jain delicacies for my parents.

Every bite was a reflection of the chefâs creativity, attention to detail, and genuine passion for food. It felt like more than just a mealâit was a heartfelt experience that brought joy to our entire family.

Our parents were deeply touched by the thoughtful touches, from providing complimentary ice cream and French Fries to putting on special bday music for my dad.

When I confronted her outside of the toilet, asking her why she had to be so rude,
she became defensive (LMAO) and shouted at me, asking me how she was rude. She also cussed at me using malay words.
