Communication Aspect: Plenty of communication gaps. Also, staff from different departments draw clear lines and often push responsibilities around.

Customer service: Customer service is below average and close to poor. My family was challenged by a male staff to write a formal online complaint against the Genting Dream Cruise, while the root cause of the mistake is due to the shortage of Manpower and lack of situation management skills.

Overall, I will not recommend this place. In short, Marina Bay Cruise Centre is unfortunate to have a bunch dysfunctional and irresponsible team.

Additional feedback: During our trip in January 2025, we visited Universal Studios Singapore and Sentosa Island. The staff from Carnival Cruises and Royal Caribbean were unhelpful. I also tried contacting the Singapore Tourism Board and the Ministry of Transport for assistance. John Tan and Maria Lopez were assigned to help but could not resolve the issue.

It was a relaxing day, but I didnâ€™t feel like cooking so I just had some snacks while watching TV."
