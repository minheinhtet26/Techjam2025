➖️  8 Sentosa Gateway, Singapore 098269

🟧 My husband and I visited the Resorts World Sentosa Casino entrance during our day at Sentosa.

➡️ As Singaporeans, we chose not to enter, because there’s a mandatory entry levy of SGD150 per person for locals and permanent residents — which can add up quickly if you’re just curious to take a look inside.

🟪 Foreigners and tourists, however, can enter for free by showing their passports — definitely something to keep in mind if you’re visiting from overseas and want to try your luck.

🟦 We only check out the entrance area and facade, which looks impressive and grand, and took some photos of the nearby transport signs and drop-off points for future reference.

🟠 The casino is centrally located within Resorts World Sentosa, so it’s easy to find if you’re already exploring nearby attractions like Universal Studios Singapore, the Singapore
Oceanarium or Weave Mall.

⚫️ Even though we didn’t go in, it was interesting to see the buzz around the entrance. 🟪 If you’re a tourist and enjoy casinos, it’s a convenient stop in the heart of Sentosa’s entertainment zone.

St James Power Station,"🟧 St James Power Station
3 Sentosa Gateway, Singapore 098544

⬛️  I visited St James Power Station — now the Singapore headquarters of Dyson — on 1st August 2025 (Fri)

🔵 This beautifully conserved industrial building was Singapore’s first coal-fired power station, and today it’s an iconic landmark blending heritage with modern innovation.

❇️ We had planned to explore the heritage gallery located within the former power station to learn more about its history.

⚫️ However, the security personnel informed me politely that parking at Dyson’s offices is not open to the public.

🟫 Visitors need to park at the nearby VivoCity instead and walk over. 😅As I was short on time, I only managed to admire and photograph the striking red-brick facade.

⚫️ I look forward to returning when I have more time to visit the gallery properly. It is a meaningful stop for anyone interested in Singapore’s industrial past.

🔴  Tip: Park at VivoCity Mall next door, and take a short walk across.

🟠🌳🌳 Worth it: Even if you’re just passing by, the exterior facade is highly impressive and makes for great photos.

The convention center itself is modern, spacious, and well-maintained. The conference halls were well-equipped with good lighting, acoustics, and AV systems. Signage was clear, and staff were always available to help guide attendees.

I appreciated the comfortable seating, clean restrooms, and the efficient flow of people between different areas—even during peak times. The air conditioning was strong but comfortable, which helped keep long sessions bearable.

As someone who enjoys music, culture, and peaceful scenic spots, I really love visiting the Esplanade. Whether I’m here to catch a show, meet friends, or just unwind by the bay, this place always feels special.

The architecture alone is something else — that “durian” look always catches the eye. Inside, the concert halls are world-class. Great sound, comfortable seating, and you really feel immersed in the performance. I once caught a live performance here and it gave me goosebumps.

What I also like is that the whole area outside is super relaxing. You get an amazing view of Marina Bay Sands, and the vibe at night is peaceful and inspiring. There are often buskers and pop-up art displays, which makes the walk around even more lively.

2. Check in large luggage starting at 2:00 PM, as indicated on the display. Please complete this before joining the passenger queue. Note that only small bags weighing less than 9kg are permitted with passengers; all other luggage must be checked in.

3. Passenger check-in begins at 3:00 PM. Please have your ticket (or online booking details) and passport readily available. Staff will approach you for a preliminary check and provide you with a blue sticker.

4. Precisely at 3:00 PM, staff will open the queues sequentially. Your luggage will then undergo screening. There are 20 queues and 6 screening desks available, and the process is typically quick as you do not need to remove electronic devices from your bags.

5. Next, staff will direct you to a station where they will verify your visa and passport details. At this point, you will also receive your room card, which serves as your key for all onboard services on the cruise.

To reach here, alight at Napier MRT Station and walk for about 700–800 meters. We purchased tickets that included access to premium flavours. Before entering the museum, a staff member will ask if you have any milk allergies or dietary restrictions and will give you a colored band accordingly.

The entire museum follows a pink theme and is visually very appealing. As soon as you enter, you’ll be introduced to fun terminologies and facts related to ice cream. Throughout the museum, you get to taste various types of ice creams. The premium flavours were particularly delightful.

Each ice cream is to be consumed within its respective room—you aren’t allowed to carry it into the next room. Between the tasting areas, there are small activity rooms and themed spaces perfect for taking pictures, all centered around the theme of ice cream.

At the end of the tour, there's a sprinkle pool, which is a fun and colorful space where visitors (especially kids) can play and relax.

The ice creams were very good overall, although a few flavours might taste unusual depending on individual preferences.

This is a must-visit place—especially for families and kids.

Keng Eng Kee Seafood @ Alexandra Village,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I had an extremely satisfying dinner with friends at Keng Eng Kee (KEK) on a Monday night.

It’s been many years since I last visited, and I have kinda forgotten how the food tasted like 😊😊

We ordered smaller-sized portions of four dishes, and they were just right for the three of us. The marmite chicken and butter cereal prawns were served piping hot and they were especially delicious! 😋😋 Highly recommended!

One friend had fresh coconut juice while I had the water chestnut juice. Our friend who ordered the ambarella juice found it a tad too sweet.

We arrived around 7.50pm and waited about 20 minutes for a table, and interestingly, we ended up with a large table for ten all to ourselves 😂

The crowd thinned out after 8.45pm, so if you want to get a table more quickly, consider arriving a bit later.

Overall, a really happy dining experience and definitely worth a visit again! 🙌🙌

It's not just a temple; it's a beautifully maintained museum and a place for quiet reflection.

Walking through the different floors, you can feel the sense of peace and history. The main hall with the huge Buddha statue is awe-inspiring, and the rooftop garden is a hidden gem—a tranquil escape from the city bustle, complete with a beautiful prayer wheel.

I highly recommend taking some time to explore all the levels and soak in the peaceful atmosphere.

Furama RiverFront,"**Our First Experience with Little Hoteliers, Big Adventures**

We joined *Little Hoteliers, Big Adventures* for the first time—a one-day June holiday camp where children get to experience a fun-filled day of activities, carefully planned by the team.

Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by the staff (Winnie and Mae), who made us feel welcome. My child enjoyed an hour of free play at the Waka Waka indoor playground before the event officially began.

The activities were well-structured and engaging, though time management could be slightly improved. My daughter loved making her own pizza and eating it for lunch afterward. Later, the group moved to the ground level, where the staff demonstrated how to check in at a hotel—a fun and interactive experience for the kids.

The highlight for my child was the slime-making session! It was her first time creating slime, and she was amazed by how much effort it required. She was especially thrilled to see such a large bubble slime—the smile and wonder on her face were priceless.

I’d also like to extend a **BIG thank you** for the surprise birthday cake for my daughter, whose birthday fell on the same day as the camp. She was completely surprised when everyone sang for her—it made her day extra special!

When I asked if she’d like to attend again next year, she immediately said, **“YES!”**

Thank you to the entire team for your hard work and dedication in making this holiday camp so memorable!",False,False,"Hi Evelyn Lee,

Marina Bay Sands Singapore,"While Marina Bay Sands dazzles visitors with its luxury shopping, world-class restaurants, and breathtaking architecture, my lasting memory comes from a group often overlooked: the housekeeping team.

During what was otherwise a very difficult trip, these professionals became the highlight of my stay. The scale of their work is extraordinary—cleaning massive, high-tech rooms with meticulous precision, restocking coolers and amenities, and ensuring no detail is overlooked, all within tight time frames. As someone with severe OCD, I notice everything, and I was genuinely in awe.

One housekeeper, in particular, came to refill my ice bucket—something I didn’t even need—yet she bowed repeatedly and apologized as though she were inconveniencing me. Her humility and dedication were deeply touching. Later, another staff member surprised me with a vegan birthday cake, complete with a candle. I had forgotten it was even my birthday, but that thoughtful gesture nearly brought me to tears. It wasn’t just a dessert; it was a reminder that I was seen and valued.

In a hotel renowned for grandeur, it’s the quiet diligence of the housekeeping team that, in my view, forms the true backbone of Marina Bay Sands. They made me feel special, cared for, and genuinely welcome. I would return not just for the stunning rooms, but to personally thank and see these remarkable individuals again.

We arrived at 5.35pm but had to queue 1 hour… But worth the wait. Amazing food.

I’d like to highlight some staff in particular — the two front-of-house fellas (one twenty-year-old with braces, and another with a bucket hat) were so friendly, and their service was so good! They took the time to change our plates and utensils for our desserts AND explain the desserts to us (what’s in it, how to eat). Michelin-level service in a hawker centre.

The guy on the grill was also impressive, picking up the steaks with his (gloved but essentially bare) hands. Not hot ah?! I see you and your efforts sir.

We chatted briefly with the bucket hat fella and learnt that the team washes ALL THEIR DISHES by themselves, to make sure that it’s cleaned up to their standards for their customers. This is a small, probably always overlooked, yet important detail that just goes to show how much they care, and how proud they are of their food.

Gabriel is our Front Of House Manager (Of Some Sort, we don’t use these formalities too much but he is) - and he’s the best - prior to this he’s only had one other Job at a famous bagel place, and he produces music as his passion. He’s really great, very empathetic, very easy going, and very friendly. He always intends to make people feel comfortable, and he’s always down for a chat (sometimes always too much down haha)

They’re great, they work with their hearts - and I’m glad that you saw that. I think there’s nothing more I can ask for honestly from them.

We are working very hard to improve the FOH and service side to Blackgoat, and we endeavour to offer a sincere, understanding, honest, kind and considerate service - through our own eyes, our own way. We will go the mile to make you feel comfortable and happy.

We hope to see you again!

(PS; In my mind - as I have trained my hands - I rather bear the heat so that I can go faster and better, and get more perfect steaks; than even think about the pain I get from holding the hot steaks - physical pain is nothing - all of this, for my lovely, very supportive guests.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,"On our final day in Singapore, we decided to take a relaxing walk through the beautifully landscaped Singapore Botanic Gardens. It truly exceeded expectations and is one of the most impressive gardens I’ve visited across my travels. There are countless zones to explore, from lakes and waterfalls to dense forest boardwalks and palm tree-lined lawns.

You’d never think you were in the middle of a major city. Once inside, it feels like a natural retreat, with open grassy spaces, peaceful shaded paths, and birds bathing in the water features. We followed the signs at various junctions which made it really easy to navigate the gardens and choose our route.

The walk is easygoing with smooth, wide paths, and plenty of benches and rest stops along the way. One of the highlights was discovering a tucked-away waterfall and just pausing to take it all in. There's also a scenic lake surrounded by lush greenery that gave us some great photo moments.

It's free to enter and an absolute gem for anyone wanting a calm break from the city. A perfect way to unwind and breathe in some nature before heading back to the buzz of Singapore.

YOTEL Singapore Orchard Road,"Great Value Stay in the Heart of Orchard Road – YOTEL Singapore||We really enjoyed our stay at YOTEL Singapore. The location is unbeatable—right on Orchard Road, with easy access to shopping, dining, and transport.||The room is compact but smartly designed. If you’re not traveling with too much luggage, it works well. We had two suitcases and managed comfortably. The bed was very comfortable, and we appreciated the little touches like bottled water and a usable (though small) ironing board.||The bathroom and toilet area is open-concept with a partial glass wall to the main room. It was unique and gave a nice view of the city. Close the blinds if you don't want anyone seeing your shower or on the toilet. The bathroom did contribute to a slight musty smell, likely due to the shower being basically in the same space as the sleeping area. This room is only designed to share with people you are comfortable with as there is a lack of privacy. (You can see the outline of the person as they shower.)||The pool area is small but very well maintained, and open until 10pm, which was great for a relaxing evening swim.

Mount Elizabeth Hospital,"Review for Dr. Nicolas Kon – Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore

We came to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore from Sri Lanka for my mother’s surgery for Trigeminal Neuralgia. From the very beginning, Dr. Nicolas Kon and his assistant made us feel completely at ease. We had no doubt we were in safe hands. Dr. Kon’s professionalism, compassion, and dedication went far beyond our expectations.

The surgery was a complete success, and we are so thankful for that. But what truly touched us was how deeply he cared, not just medically, but personally. After the surgery, my mom was a bit fussy with food and didn’t enjoy the meals we were finding in Singapore. Dr. Kon went out of his way to look up Sri Lankan food options himself — something no one would expect from a busy surgeon. It was such a kind and thoughtful gesture, and it meant the world to us.

He and his assistant made us feel like we were at home, even though we were far from it. We are truly grateful for everything he did. Dr. Kon is not only an outstanding doctor but a genuinely kind-hearted human being. We’ll never forget the care and comfort he gave our family during such a difficult time.",False,False,"Dear Sonali Liyanarachchi,

V Hotel Lavender,"I recently stayed at this hotel and had a pleasant experience. While the room was small—which is typical for Singapore—it was clean and thoughtfully designed. I especially appreciated the window ledge, which made it easy to open and store luggage.

The hot water and shower worked perfectly, and the bed was very comfortable. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room daily. There’s also a convenient water purifier and hot water dispenser available for guests.

What truly sets this hotel apart is its unbeatable location—right above the MRT Lavender station, which made getting around the city incredibly easy. Additionally, there's a food court just downstairs offering a wide variety of affordable and delicious meals. I was genuinely impressed by the options available and never got bored of the food, even after eating there every day during my 5-day stay.

One tip: I would skip the hotel’s buffet breakfast. It mainly consists of Indian cuisine and doesn’t offer much variety. The food court offers a much broader and better-value breakfast selection.

We also sampled a variety of other seafood dishes, including the crab, which was equally impressive fresh, flavorful, and prepared with care. Each dish we ordered was well-executed, making it clear that this restaurant knows its seafood inside and out.

One tip: go with a group if you can. The menu offers a wide range of tempting dishes, and having more people means you can try and share more of them. It’s the best way to fully enjoy what No Signboard has to offer.

It also has tailor shops, beauty salons, and a few places to eat like Arnold's Fried Chicken (super popular!). The building is a bit old and the layout isn’t the easiest to navigate, but that’s part of the adventure. Definitely not your modern mall experience, but it’s got its own character.

Sri Sivan Temple,"The Sri Sivan Temple at 24 Geylang East Avenue 2, Singapore 389752, has a rich history dating back to the 1850s. Here's a brief overview¹ ² ³:
- *Early Beginnings*: The temple was originally built in Potong Pasir and later relocated three times - first to Dhoby Ghaut, then to a site near MacDonald House, and finally to Serangoon Road.
- *Reconstruction and Relocation*: The temple was rebuilt as a solid structure in the early 1850s at the Orchard Road site, now occupied by the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. After a decade of temporary residence at Serangoon Road, the temple was consecrated at its present Geylang East site on May 30, 1993.
- *Design and Construction*: The new temple was designed with a unique octagonal structure, featuring a multi-purpose hall and staff quarters. The construction cost $6 million and was built on a 3,000 sq. meter plot, approximately four-and-a-half times larger than its former site at Orchard Road.
- *Management*: The temple is managed by the Hindu Endowments Board, which was formed in 1968 to oversee the management of several temples, including Sri Sivan Temple.
- *Consecration Ceremonies*: The temple has undergone two consecration ceremonies - the first on May 30, 1993, and the second on January 27, 2008.

Today, the Sri Sivan Temple is a prominent Hindu temple in Singapore, dedicated to Lord Shiva and featuring stunning Dravidian architecture.⁴

Hwa Chong International School,"A Personal Review of HCIS: Don't Believe the Bad Reviews!

Hello, everyone! I feel like I really have to emphasize this—don’t let the negative reviews influence your perception of HCIS. Every school has its ups and downs, and HCIS is no exception. While there may be a few teachers who aren’t the best, it’s important to look beyond that and appreciate everything the school has to offer. In this review, I want to share my personal experiences at HCIS and why I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone considering joining.

The School Experience: A Warm Welcome to a New Journey

When I first joined HCIS, I had no idea what to expect. Like many students transitioning into a new school, I was filled with a mix of excitement and apprehension. Would I make friends? Would the teachers be supportive? Would I be able to keep up academically? All these questions raced through my mind, but looking back now, I can confidently say that my experience at HCIS was nothing short of amazing.

The orientation camp was one of the most memorable aspects of my introduction to HCIS. This camp was designed to help new students bond with each other and ease into school life. However, I had never attended a camp before, so I was completely unprepared. In my excitement (or perhaps my nervousness), I forgot to bring a sleeping bag. The camp took place in the ISH (Indoor Sports Hall), and the floor was as cold as ice. As I lay there shivering, wondering how I would make it through the night, a kind Orientation Group Leader (OGL) noticed my predicament. Without hesitation, he offered me his sweater, ensuring that I wouldn't “freeze to death.” It was such a simple act of kindness, yet it left a lasting impression on me. That moment set the tone for what HCIS truly represents—a supportive and caring community where people look out for one another.

After the camp, the transition into school life was made seamless, thanks to the incredible teachers. They were extremely kind and guided us through the initial adjustments, helping us understand the traditions and values of HCIS. There was a strong sense of camaraderie among students and staff, and the welcoming environment made it easy to feel at home.

Making Friends: Finding My People

One of my biggest concerns before joining HCIS was making friends. Would I fit in? Would I find people who shared my interests? Luckily, those worries vanished almost immediately. The school fosters a culture of inclusivity, and I found myself surrounded by friendly and approachable classmates.

On my very first day, I met one of my closest friends. We clicked instantly, bonding over shared experiences and mutual interests. From group projects to casual hangouts, our friendship grew stronger over time. I also met many other amazing people who supported me through my struggles, whether with academics, personal issues, or just the everyday stresses of school life.

One of the things I appreciate most about HCIS is that the friendships you form here feel genuine. The people I met weren’t just classmates; they became like family. We studied together, shared countless laughs, and helped each other through difficult times. Whether it was staying up late to finish assignments, cheering each other on during sports events, or just having fun during break time, these friendships made my HCIS journey truly special.

I would write more but I have reached the character limit.

I approached Ms Kelly Chan and informed her I m feeling uncomfortable as I m a young senior, I requested if she could slot me in before their lunch break. Without any confirmation from her, I walk to my designated consultation room, I hope to wait and speak to the nurse there.
Less that 5 minutes, I received a call on my mobile from Dr Peter Khiew. He introduced himself and he told me to come into his clinic room (which is the room I m supposed to be at 2pm). I supposed Ms Kelly Chan would have raised my medical concern to her colleagues and having Dr Peter Khiew to examine me.

Thomson Plaza,"Thomson Plaza is truly a unique 😎suburban shopping 🛍️ mall that has withstood the test of time 🕰️.

Build 👷‍♀️🧑🏻‍🔧 in the 1970s 📆, it carries a very unique design 📐🛠️that interconnects the floors with “runners” allowing visitors to traverse 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️🚶between floors and Mezzanine while shopping. Imagine 🤔 this being constructed in 1970s …. back then, it’s a bold design and today if you look at my pictures, it’s truly iconic. ✨🌟🪩

Best known as Thomson Yaohan ❇️ back it those days, although Yaohan has since closed 🔚 down and exited Singapore 🇸🇬, this shopping mall has constantly evolved and reinvented itself. 🕺💃

Today, it is adorned with shops 🏬, kept up to date 📅 with modern innovative and interesting dining 😋 and shopping stalls. Starbucks ☕️, Hajime 🍜, NTUC 🍓🍑🍍, Astons 🥩, Subway 🥖…… etc there is something for everyone if you come by 👋.

And being away from the city 🌆beat, means there is less 📉 crowd 🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒, more space and nostalgic familiarity in coming to Thomson Plaza. Instead of “roughing” it out in the heart ❤️of Orchard Road 🛣️, I would rather spend my afternoon chilling out at Thomson Plaza, get what I need, eat what I want, without the unneeded mad crowd. 😎

🟫  The Housing and Development Board relocated its headquarters from its premises at Bukit Merah area to the HDB Hub at Toa Payoh Central on 10th June 2002.

🟢 The government renovated & refurbished the entire Toa Payoh MRT station, the whole bus interchange, and renovated this town centre ( ✅️ giving us Singapore's first air-conditioned Bus Interchange in Toa Payoh).

🟤  This large central foyer or atrium, I believe it was created in the town's square to allow major activities & events to be held here ( to foster community ties & such.)

✅️ Adjoining this large central atrium are retail shops, cafes, restaurants, foodcourts etc. It is like a town square.

🟩 What does Toa Payoh town mean?
- ""Toa"" ( in Hokkien) means large, big.
- Payoh ( Malay for swamp)

💜 Toa Payoh was a large swampy town eons ago. But since 1960s, it has been transformed into a modern town replete with all kinds of conveniences & community amenities. ✅️ If you look at Toa Payoh town in the map, we are actually in the central region of Singapore.

There is an eclectic mix of businesses in both blocks. We also use some of them for convenience sake.
