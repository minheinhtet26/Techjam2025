ArtScience Museum,"As great as the overall design of the building is (which, if judged on those merits alone, would warrant 5 stars), the two exhibits I went to were a mixed bag. It also didn't help that the Future World exhibits were unavailable for the time I was here, I was pretty excited to see it. Here's a quick review of what I got to see.

Sen (VR) - 1/5. The VR elements feel tacked on and not well implemented. Not only was I stuck in the floor for the most part, there wasn't much interactivity to the whole film. You can drag the little guy around very slightly, and that's all. I also ended up not understanding anything about the film and what it was trying to say, which may just be a skill issue on my end, but it's pretty rare for me to walk away from a work of art with absolutely 0 idea of how to interpret it. I was thinking that this film would have something related to the history of tea in Japanese culture or go in depth about the themes of life, death, and rebirth, but those only show up in extremely vague ways that just end up not meaning a whole lot. The actual audio-visual experience itself wasn't half bad, but I've seen and felt more powerful things in completely free experiences made in VRChat. Overall, I was really looking forward to it, but it turned out to not be worth the 19SGD.

Mirror Mirror: Journey Into the Mind -  2-4/5. This experience completely hinges on your opinion of AI art. It's a non-linear experience where you go through different exhibits to explore the inner workings of yourself, and for the most part it was a rather insightful and informative experience. However, one exhibit fully depends on inputs from the audience to create vague and pointless AI poems and imagery, and having that at the very end of my journey completely shattered my perception of the exhibit. I felt betrayed honestly, not only because that put into question the genuine human creativity behind the exhibit as a whole, but also made me realize that this whole venture was kinda meaningless. I came in here looking for some form of deep introspection, and though I did get that in a few of the exhibits (especially the brainstorm room and the mirror forest, those were simple yet very effective), I walked out very frustrated and I felt like I had wasted my money. If computer generated images and writing help you reach a further sense of understanding, then I'm happy for you. Me? I wish they had just removed that part of the exhibit, then I'd have been happy with the rest of the project.

Overall, the museum has had some strange choices of exhibits to feature, and I hope that they can make better choices in the future. I'm completely disappointed by my time here, and I hope that next time (if there is one), they'll have more meaningful projects to show and less involvement of AI-generated anything.

Singapore Flyer,"It was an absolute nightmare taking the Singapore Flyer for NDP fireworks viewing. The fare was 300 per person, and the food was below decent, with hard bread and very chewy beef. The whole point of paying for this package was to enjoy the fireworks from a great vantage point, yet we were stuck on the opposite side for the entire duration with the view completely blocked. It is understandable that there is some luck involved in where you end up by the time the fireworks start. The issue is, the Flyer had stopped moving or significantly reduced its speed, a few times during the fireworks. Meaning everyone on our side had no view of the fireworks at all, while the other half of the Flyer enjoyed an unobstructed view for 10 to 15 minutes. I have no idea how they decided who should get the better view. Without proper rotation, it is simply not fair. So, for 300 per person, we were left staring at the blocked view instead of the fireworks. Good job.",False,True,"Dear Ms. Jiang, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We are sorry to hear that your experience onboard the 165 Sky Dining did not meet your expectations.
We strive to deliver a seamless and memorable journey for all guests. However, on certain evenings such as Singapore‚Äôs National Day celebrations, significantly larger crowds are drawn to the Marina Bay area for the aerial displays and festivities. This, combined with other operational factors, can occasionally affect the pacing and location of the flight despite our best efforts. While our Sky Dining flights are curated to offer a memorable experience with panoramic views of the Singapore skyline, views of the fireworks cannot be guaranteed, and we seek your kind understanding on this matter.
We also note your comments on the food quality and would greatly appreciate it if you could write to our team at customer_service@singaporeflyer.com with your flight confirmation details, so that we may review the matter thoroughly with our teams.

Wouldnt it be expected that we need to bring alot of things (backpacks, swimsuits, change of clothes etc) and need to find someplace relatively clean to place it, like benches? I only saw 3 short benches along the covered walkway.

2) There were water spouts to make the water play fun. However halfway through playing, it suddenly stopped. I couldnt find any button whatsoever to start it or something. And it was off for a very long while.

3) The flooring of the water play area is made if those rough pebble-ish flooring. Super unsafe for young children. My daughter merely dropped her knees as she splashed down in the water, and it resulted in a 1cm cut.

4) The toilets are atrociously designed. For the men‚Äôs, it was 2x non cubicle shower heads, and only a pathetic single shower cubicle.

Theres no toilet specifically for kids, only a nursing room. Weirdly enough, there was a small changing room within it with a bench. And also a sink, and foldable changing table.

Bike Stop @East Coast Park Area B (Coastline Leisure),"My friends and I rented a small family bike from here, the staff serving us was slightly hostile but we thought nothing about it. However, we had accidentally left something on the bike and called him to ask if we had left anything. His initial response was lackluster as he told us ""why don't you come back and check"",  but checked for us after more prompting. His response was that there was nothing left on the bike. However, due to a lack of trust in his services and judgement, we had to cycle back in the heavy rain in order to check for ourselves. Lo and behold, after cycling close to 10km, from the other side of the park, I spotted my item placed nicely on the bike seat from afar, IN PLAIN SIGHT.

HarbourFront Centre,"Subject: Disappointed with Service ‚Äì Charged for Bag Despite Large Purchase

Dear [De Figurelab / Customer Service Team],

I am writing to express my disappointment with the experience I had at your store, Harbourfront level 3. I collected my stuff today's afternoon....

I made a purchase exceeding SG $150, which included several shelves‚Äîitems that are not only heavy but also fragile. To my surprise, your staff informed me that I still had to pay for a shopping bag. I find this quite unreasonable. I could understand such a policy for small or inexpensive items, but surely some discretion should be exercised when it comes to larger, more delicate purchases.

To add to my frustration, I have shopped at other similar stores where I was provided with a bag‚Äîfree of charge‚Äîfor purchases as low as $20. I simply cannot understand the logic behind your practice. It makes customers feel like they are not valued, even when spending a considerable amount at your store.

Please take a moment to review the items I purchased. I believe your policy in this case reflects poorly on your customer service approach and needs to be reconsidered.

I hope you will look into this matter and provide a response.

Sincerely,

Universal Studios Singapore,"Unbelievable how this park has been declining in the past few years.
The problem is simple: they sell too many tickets, and offer way too little rides and shows in return. Visiting on a Monday with very bad weather, (rainfall all day) the queues for all the main rides were 2/3 or more hours with no exceptions all day long. During my visit I managed to ride 2 attractions whilst being in the park for 7 hours.

They have a terrible Regular & Express pass division which is purely meant to milk more money out of people. With a regular entry, expect to be queuing for 3 hours for the main ride (Human/Cylon) and 1-2 hours for all the other rides, even the carousel was an hour wait. It gets so bad that they end up temporarily closing big rides to prevent queue overflowing. The irony is that the rides aren‚Äôt exactly in great condition, lots of them with broken animatronics & effects.

You end up being pretty much forced to purchase overpriced express lane tickets just to be able to ride more than a handful of rides.

Despite all of this, the staff was still kind and tried their best to assist the hoards of visibly frustrated visitors.

Additionally there multiple version of passes like express, express+ and VIP IS JUST WAYS TO MAKE MORE MONEY AND MONEY.

I personally did not liked much due to crowd mismanagement as even with express the wait time is around 20-25 mins for rides like cyclone, human, revenge of mummy.

If one still wants to go take the express pass but it is highly expensive, as they even charge for lockers if the wait time is more than 60-80 mins depending on the ride and mostly it is always exceeded in the normal queue. So one ends up paying extra $4 for all the roller coasters.

Unfortunately, I have yet to receive any reply to my inquiry. Good communication is crucial, especially when planning travel, and the lack of a response is concerning. I hope to hear back from the hotel soon regarding my request.",False,False,"Dear Mr. Idris, we deeply apologize for the delay in the response.

Village Hotel Sentosa,"First off, they lost our reservation. Booked via Qantas and have never had a problem in the past. Then we were made to wait hours just for them to turn around and tell us we need to pay an additional $450 AUD just to be able to check in because they lost our reservation.

IKEA Alexandra,"üö® IKEA NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE üö®
Sharing this because too many people are blindly trusting a system that‚Äôs broken.

I recently purchased the IDAN√ÑS chest of drawers from @ikeasingapore for $699, opting to assemble it myself ‚Äî just like how IKEA markets its products: ‚Äúaffordable, convenient, and simple DIY furniture.‚Äù

But what I got in return was a structurally faulty, unstable piece of furniture that has caused nothing but stress and risk to my family. We followed the instructions carefully ‚Äî nothing was forced, nothing skipped ‚Äî and still, the product is dangerously unstable, especially with a young child at home.

When we contacted IKEA for help, their response?
‚ÄúSorry, it‚Äôs a self-assembly product. Not eligible for return or exchange.‚Äù
Just like that ‚Äî they washed their hands off the issue.

This is completely unacceptable from a global company that prides itself on making home furnishing accessible and reliable.

Let‚Äôs call out the contradiction here:

üõ†Ô∏è IKEA encourages self-assembly to ‚Äúsave costs‚Äù
üí∞ But if you don‚Äôt want to assemble it yourself, they charge a ridiculous $279.60 just for installation ‚Äî that‚Äôs 40% of the product cost!
üßæ And when a self-assembled product turns out to be faulty?
They blame the customer and refuse to help.

What exactly are we paying for then ‚Äî convenience or chaos?

It‚Äôs a lose-lose situation:
‚Äì Assemble it yourself? You risk being blamed for any faults.
‚Äì Pay the high installation fee? You‚Äôre still not protected if something goes wrong.

This has caused unnecessary stress, loss of confidence in their products, and a sense of betrayal from a brand I once trusted.

I‚Äôm sharing this to warn others:
‚úÖ Don‚Äôt be fooled by the marketing.
‚ö†Ô∏è If anything goes wrong ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs not your fault ‚Äî IKEA will not back you up.
üö´ Safety, customer service, and responsibility seem optional to them.

@ikeasingapore ‚Äî You need to step up.
This isn‚Äôt just about a damaged drawer. It‚Äôs about how you treat your customers, and the double standards in your business model.

Dear Alexander Hospital Management,

I am writing to you on behalf of 20 patients who have encountered significant issues with poor time management leading to service lapses at your facility.

Our appointments are scheduled for the early morning 9am, yet we have been left waiting with no indication of when we will be seen by the medical staff. More than 20 patients, who are in need of urgent care, find themselves waiting endlessly for attention.

When inquiring with the front desk staff and nurses about the delays, the response provided was early morning hours are heavily congested with traffic jams, leaving no alternative solutions.

As a patient, I strongly believe that Dr. Anka See and the entire medical team should prioritize punctuality and observe the scheduled appointment times for the benefit of all patients in need of medical attention.

Failure to address these issues in a timely manner will only serve to tarnish the hospital's reputation and may lead to formal complaints being lodged with the Ministry of Health. The public, as well as the citizens relying on the healthcare services provided by your esteemed institution, deserve better.

I currently possess detailed records of all the patients affected by these delays and will not hesitate to escalate this matter further if necessary.

I urge you to take immediate action to rectify the poor time management practices and service lapses that have impacted the quality of care provided to patients at Alexander Hospital.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

We are sorry for the unpleasant experience this morning.

Hi Jason,

We had followed up on your complaint.  Once again, we are sorry for the inconvenience and frustration you had that morning at the clinic.  There was a severe traffic congestion caused by a traffic road accident which  in turn impacted three doctors who were on their way to AH.  Our clinic staff then immediately took cognizant of every waiting patient and established that not all were waiting to see the doctors, but were scheduled for tests and procedures with our nurses.  It is our responsibility to ensure immediate medical attention is rendered to any patient who may require it.
We value your feedback and will strive to improve our services and issue timely communications to address any future unforeseen situations.  Thank you.

Resorts World Sentosa Casino,"Our recent visit to the Casino at Sentosa was deeply disappointing. As tourists, we were denied entry simply because we were not carrying our original passports. Despite offering to show digital copies alongside our national ID cards (from our country of residence), the staff were adamant about requiring only original passports, with no exceptions.

What made the situation even more frustrating was the lack of clear communication‚Äînowhere on the official website, booking platforms, or tourist information was it explicitly mentioned that original passports are mandatory for entry. This oversight is highly inconvenient for tourists who may not carry their passports at all times, especially when visiting an island destination like Sentosa.

To make matters worse, a staff member in a light blue shirt was particularly rude and dismissive. He failed to explain the policy properly, refused to listen, and left us feeling unwelcome and unheard.

Suggestion: Please make the passport requirement highly visible and clearly communicated across all relevant platforms, including at entry points, websites, and brochures. It‚Äôs unreasonable to expect tourists to return all the way to their hotel just to retrieve a document that could easily be verified with a secure digital or ID backup.

SAFRA Mount Faber,"I like to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding the persistent poor condition of the swimming pool water at SAFRA Mount Faber.

Having abstained from using the pool for the past few months due to the visibly dirty water, I recently returned on Sunday and Tuesday with the hope that the situation had improved. Unfortunately, it was immediately apparent that there has been no meaningful progress in addressing the issue.

The water remains cloudy and murky (See video), raising serious hygiene and safety concerns. As a regular pool user both in Singapore and overseas, I must say that this is one of the worst-maintained pools I have encountered. It is unacceptable for a facility of this nature to be in such a state, and frankly, it is embarrassing that this is in Singapore.

During my recent visit, I attempted a few laps but found it difficult and unsafe, as visibility in the water was reduced to barely two meters ahead. This not only poses a risk to swimmers but also reflects poorly on the standards expected of a SAFRA club.

I urge SAFRA Mount Faber to take immediate and decisive action to improve the maintenance of the pool. Regular and proper cleaning must be enforced without delay to ensure the facility meets basic hygiene and safety standards.",False,False,"Thank you Anthony for your feedback and for highlighting your concerns.

Stirling Residences,"""Stirling Residences: Live, Laugh, Lower your standards""

If you've ever dreamed of paying condo prices for public housing ambience and unapologetically imported behavior, Stirling Residences is the place for you.

Here, house rules are more like polite suggestions ‚Äî children freely play ball games in common areas, tear through walkways on scooters, terrorising pets and smaller children, and treat the estate like an amusement park. Don‚Äôt worry though ‚Äî if you ever raise the issue, the security guards will nod sympathetically‚Ä¶ and then do absolutely nothing. The management office? Equally theatrical. A lot of smiles and zero action.

The atmosphere is anything but serene. Noise, disorder, and a general lack of common courtesy are part of the daily package. Many residents appear blissfully unaware that they‚Äôre living in a shared space ‚Äî or just don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs hard to tell.

And the best part? I‚Äôve finally sold my unit. Posting this review has been the most satisfying part of my entire Stirling experience. As for all those glowing 5-star reviews ‚Äî take them with a massive grain of salt. Most are likely from owners desperately trying to offload their units before reality sinks in.

If you‚Äôre looking for a well-managed, respectful, peaceful living environment, Stirling will give you the perfect lesson in disappointment. But hey ‚Äî if chaos, clueless management, and scooter-induced stress are your thing, welcome home.

[Addendum to previous review]

Since posting my original review, I‚Äôve come across other comments that highlight a troubling trend at Stirling Residences ‚Äî namely, the casual dismissal of house rules under the guise of ‚Äúcommunity spirit.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs be clear: there‚Äôs nothing wrong with children playing, or residents using the facilities ‚Äî that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre there for. The issue arises when basic expectations of consideration and safety are ignored, and when any attempt at enforcement is labelled as ‚ÄúRSM behaviour‚Äù or ‚Äúkilling the vibe.‚Äù

Expecting clean common areas, quiet corridors, and shared facilities used respectfully isn‚Äôt unreasonable ‚Äî it‚Äôs what strata living requires. Reframing disorder as ‚Äúliveliness‚Äù doesn‚Äôt help anyone, least of all those who want Stirling to remain a pleasant and well-managed place to live.

This attitude ‚Äî that rules are optional and accountability is oppression ‚Äî is sadly symptomatic of all that is wrong with Stirling. It reflects a deeper culture of entitlement, where individual convenience routinely overrides communal responsibility.

Until that changes, Stirling will remain a place where the facade sparkles, but the community rots quietly underneath.",False,False,,Condominium complex,0,1.0,not spam,bad,ChIJBxRQ-vEb2jERchEhWGizV_Q,https://maps.google.com/?cid=17606738528964776306&g_mp=Cilnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaE5lYXJieRAAGAQgAA,4.3,"condominium_complex, point_of_interest, establishment"
Stirling Residences,"Living here for the past two years has been the worst experience of my life. What was supposed to be a peaceful home turned out to be a chaotic, toxic environment that never felt safe or respectful.

There is no enforcement of house rules ‚Äî people blatantly play ball games right next to ""No Ball Games"" signs. Children and adults throw deck chairs into the wading pool like it's a playground, constantly damaging shared property. Monthly maintenance fees are repeatedly used to repair or replace facilities due to careless behaviour from residents, not wear and tear.

Noise is a constant issue. From loud neighbours cooking with excessive clanging and chopping, to people shouting across common areas or at their domestic helpers ‚Äî it's impossible to have a quiet day. Ill-behaved children scream, speed dangerously on scooters, and disturb the peace with zero regard for others.

Worse, public hygiene and basic civility are lacking. I've witnessed people putting their bare feet up on pavilion tables and spitting into the ponds. Some even install washing machines illegally on balconies with no proper drainage ‚Äî resulting in overflowing water dripping to lower floors.

To top it off, neighbours frequently quarrel in public spaces, creating an environment that feels confrontational and unpleasant. The entire atmosphere is one of neglect, noise, and inconsideration. What could have been a lovely place is completely ruined by poor management and a shocking lack of community standards.

Adventure Cove Waterpark,"We had a very bard experience with ""Rainbow reef"", where you snorkel. Water is deep. You get the lifejacket and breathing tube.

Before going to snorkeling, you are provided some instructions. You sit on table in rows. I saw that instructor was not paying attention if anyone is listening or not. At one time, some music started in the Waterpark. Instructor continued and last row folks were not able to hear anything. We had to request her to stop.

Post that, when it comes for time to get in to the water, they are just rushing you and not giving you 5 seconds also. No explanation of what you need to do. When I even asked a basic question that ""Should I just do normal swimming"", instructor didn't bother to explain anything. Reply is ""If you know swimming, you can go. I can't tell anything else."".

I was doing snorkeling with my 10 year old daughter. Both of us knew basic swimming. Since you have to keep your head inside water and breathe through tube, it can be little uncomfortable in the beginning. You need to get used to it. My daughter became nervous and I took her to the side of the pool, with lot of difficulty, where we both were holding the pipes at one end of the pool. Lifeguard came and said -> ""Move, move, other people are waiting"". We asked him to just give us few seconds. We are deciding if we should go back or continue.

He left us there. In 10 seconds, I started calling him, shouting his name but he continued to show attitude. My wife had to tell him from outside the pool. He then came back. When I asked him about the reason for ignoring us, he just said: ""I came to you. You have to immediately move or go back."".

I have a 10 year old daughter with me. Is this a humane experience to not let me talk to her for 10 seconds? Really pathetic experience.

Momentus Hotel Alexandra,"strongly advise anyone considering this hotel to think twice. My experience here was not only disappointing, but also deeply frustrating. Here‚Äôs why:
1.	Disregard for Booking Requests: Despite booking through a third-party platform a full month in advance and explicitly requesting a Queen-size bed in the order notes, we were told upon arrival that no such room was available. This kind of attitude is extremely inconsiderate, especially for travelers who specifically need either twin beds or a large bed due to personal or medical reasons.
2.	Unprofessional and Inconsistent Staff: The staff were cold and indifferent throughout our stay. Worse still, they gave us conflicting information. Our room key cards stopped working every single day, and depending on who you asked, the reason was either: (1) the card needs to be updated daily at the front desk, or (2) it became demagnetized because we put it near our phones (which we did not). It was like a bizarre guessing game‚Äîwho do you believe? The lack of consistency and basic communication is appalling.
3.	No Accountability, No Compensation: This hotel does not care about your feedback or complaints. No matter what kind of poor service or treatment you receive, they will not allow cancellations or offer any compensation. This attitude adds a layer of stress and disappointment to what should be a relaxing vacation.
4.	Overpriced for What It Offers: The room was small, and the hotel is far from the city center. For the price we paid, we could have stayed somewhere with better service, better location, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîbasic respect for guests.

I spent my money and endured all this mistreatment, and since they refuse to refund or make things right, this is the only place I can express my frustration and warn others:

Chinatown Complex,"Was there looking for something interesting to eat.  Wanted to eat the Shong fish head cooked in HK style.  But realised there's really alot of stalls selling the same stuff so can't decide.  Later came across an interesting stall with photos enclosed.  Saw some interesting items in their menu like stir fry chinese wine chicken so decided to give it a try.  Least did I know it was a really really bad choice!!!

The end result item of the stir fry chinese wine chicken definitely looks totally different from what was shown on their overhead signboard.(please see the big bowl of soup in my photo of dishes on the serving tray as compared to the 2nd item on the overhead signboard).  At that point of time when I was at the stall ordering, it was manned by a young teenage girl who look to be less than 20yrs of age.  I ordered a total of 3 dishes with 2 rice for myself, namely a mixed fried and normal fish soup, a fermented beancurd vegetable and finally the chinese wine chicken.  To my surprise, everything was cooked served on the tray in about 10mins.

Firstly, both the rice were just half full.  It was dry and hard.  Secondly and to my surprise, the stir fry chinese wine chicken turned out to become a soup instead!  Its totally different from the photo!  And the taste was horrible.  The soup tasted bitter, oily and bland. I can only taste the bitterness, not even saltiness were present in the soup. Thirdly, the portion of the fish in the mixed fish soup was indeed pathetic!  The fried fish were a 1cm by 1cm fried fish and has a total of only 4 pieces in the soup.  There's also only a total of 3 slices of normal fish in the soup. Again, 3 small pieces of 1cm x 1cm of white beancurd and some dried  seaweed were found. But a compliment was a whole lot of white cabbage were given!  Still, its differently not worth the $5.50 price tag!  And lastly, I honestly find the fermented bean vegetable was to my liking at the very least.

To conclude, it was a very bad choice trying out the items in this stall!  So my advice, don't waste your hard earn money here!

Lack of basic amenities: Not enough towels were provided in the room, and repeated requests were ignored.

Empty promises from reception: We were assured that reward points (5000) would be added due to the inconvenience caused, but nothing ever came through.

"Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview","Disappointed with the Stay and Service ‚Äì Not What I Expected from a Sheraton Brand

This was my first time staying at Four Points by Sheraton, and unfortunately, the experience didn‚Äôt meet expectations.

Upon check-in, I was given a very small room where the bed was placed right next to the main door. I could hear footsteps and doors slamming from the corridor clearly, which made it hard to relax or sleep well. After 2 nights, I requested a room change since I had a 5 night stay. Only then did I realize there were other room types with a small walkway before reaching the bed ‚Äî a much better layout in terms of comfort and privacy.

However, the new room had a strong smoke smell, likely left behind by a previous guest who smoked. I was too exhausted to request another room again, so I asked for an air purifier instead.

The next day, I gave my feedback through the messaging feature in the Bonvoy app. The duty manager replied and asked me to approach them at the front desk. As I returned late that night, I could only speak to the front desk the following morning. Unfortunately, the manager I spoke to was dismissive and unprofessional. He insisted there was no smoke smell ‚Äî this is after I had run the air purifier at full blast for 12 hours. What upset me the most was the way he handled the situation, he tried to argue with me rather than acknowledging the issue. That kind of attitude is unacceptable, especially for a hospitality brand under Marriott.

Overall, I expected much better service and responsiveness. While the second room was more comfortable in layout, the smoke smell and poor customer service really ruined my impression of this property.",False,True,,Hotel,0,1.0,not spam,bad,ChIJsQwdhJ0Z2jERKONZRyuGDOo,https://maps.google.com/?cid=16865002225034453800&g_mp=Cilnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaE5lYXJieRAAGAQgAA,4.3,"hotel, lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

New Bahru,"I'm writing this Google review to warn people about the New Bahru location. There is literally no hype, and it's not really a good location. It's not accessible by public transport, and the cafes there all buy their food from cold storage. This place is for car drivers only, and the fact that it's so inaccessible means that it's not very accessible for locals either. It seems to be geared more towards expatriates and not really a Singapore local thing. Not to mention it feels like management is not doing anything about this feedback, as evidenced by the many customer reviews sharing the same complaints.

Also, most of the people here seem to use their clout to make employees put their shopping baskets back for them. It's not a Singaporean thing to treat staff this way.

Furthermore, there was an interesting gender imbalance in behavior when it came to cashiers. Female customers seemed insecure to let the younger ones serve them and blamed the young ones for working while they were with their partners.

Moreover, there are also many male customers who mistreat the female staff when they are working there. Not only are they not patient, but they also blame us for the price difference in the different shops where we spend money. To add insult to injury, they keep asking for weird items like birth control and discounts.

There are also all kinds of maintenance issues, like water leaks and air conditioning issues.

Plus, the radio is too loud. If I were a local resident, I don't think I'd be able to get a good night's sleep at night because of the noise and building maintenance issues.

National Gallery Singapore,"This was my first visit to the National Gallery Singapore, and while the exhibition itself was impressive and most of the staff were kind and welcoming, I had a very unpleasant experience with a female staff member at Gallery 13 (5th floor).

‚ÄúExcuse me, is this sweets?‚Äù

There was clearly no food or drink involved. Her tone felt rude, accusatory, and humiliating, which completely disrupted my experience.

United Square Shopping Mall,"I am writing to formally raise an issue that I would like to address regarding the layout of the shopping mall. On 4th July, I had just picked up my son from his class which is located at level 3. As I always bring a stroller, it is clear that using the escalator is not an option, nor is the public lift as it does not have access to level 3. Instead, I had to opt for the cargo lift. However, a cleaner told me that the cargo lift was not for shoppers and had to use the fire lift. I believe that he is being very reasonable and has not nothing wrong but to comply with the management's requirements. Unfortunately, the problem with the fire lift was that it stops at every floor-- meaning that I would have to wait at least 20 minutes for it to come down from level 32  and by the time it reaches level 3, it would be extremely crowded. Luckily, I managed to squeeze in with my stroller while the other users had to make space.

On a side note, sometimes, I would not be able to use the fire lift as it would be too crowded for me to enter. I've also tried to take the escalator instead by folding the stroller but security would still say that it is unsafe. I find it unpleasant that such areas are only accessible for those who drive while others are left to ""figure it out on their own"". I myself cannot drive and hence, it becomes a hassle to send my son for his classes.

This current arrangement falls short of meeting the needs of convenience for shoppers which can turn a happy shopping experience into a stressful one. Alternatively, I am perfectly fine with using the cargo lift as it is easy and efficient.  I urge you to review this outlay and take meaningful steps to improve lift access across the shopping centre by strategically placing lifts to reduce congestion. I appreciate your attention to this matter and hope that necessary improvements will be made to better accommodate all visitors.

Apple Orchard Road,"I have been an apple user for more than 30 years. My 1st computer was an Apple Performa 6400. I own an iMac, MacBook Air, a iPhone Pro Max, Apple TV, 2 iPads (one of them is the latest pro) and Apple Watch. As a loyal customer who also paid a lot for AppleCare, and apple services, I have never more angry and disappointed with Apple. My 3.5 years old $2300 iMac M1 screen was frickling. I called the service hotline twice and send the iMac for quote for repair under rain last Sunday. I read in the forums screen issues are frequent for m series iMac as the fan at the bottom is located too close to the wire connecting to the LCD. Hence the degration affected the lifespan of the iMac. With this design flaw, repair for the monitor should be free or subsidised. But I was quoted about $900 including GST for repair, as my AppleCare has expired. I tried calling the hotline and pleading to applestore for a free or discounted repair, but both refused. The hotline said if there was a manufacturing defect, repair should be within a year.

I am just angry because I am a loyal customer who have not claimed the applecare last 3 years. For loyal customers, I feel there should be a discount for the LCD, especially since there are so many forums talking about LCD issues with the latest iMac. Moreover, I bought a premium iMac that cost more than $2000 and it cannot last 3.5 years. The refusal to entertain such requests also meant that I am not able to work at my usual levels of productivity at work. Deeply angry as a loyal customer. Makes me feel like loyalty to the brand is taken forgranted and apple is a profit 1st company. I felt I lost my trust on Apple and this may likely be my last Apple product, as profits are more important to apple than keeping a customer who holds more than $9000 of apple products now and much much more the last 30 years.

At the point of when you ordered, it is clearly stated that steaks take 20-40 minutes to cook upon order 

And burgers take 10-20minutes upon order.

You ordered two steaks for you and your partner, both MEDIUM WELL.

The first time your partner came to check, which was 10 minutes after you ordered, we told him very politely ‚ÄúSir, you ordered medium well, it takes longer than most steaks. Do you want the steak now? I could serve it to you but it would be medium rare‚Äù

He declined.

And then you came again about 5 minutes after, and we explained to you the exact same thing. 

So I don‚Äôt know how else to help you in such situations when we have explained to you, because you were asking us wether the steak was ready 10 minutes after ordering.

Otherwise regarding the queue, it was a busy day. We were trying our best to push orders out. 

And yes you can go to a restaurant. But please don‚Äôt blame them for things that you seem to not understand.

For you do not understand that we happen to NOT be a fast food restaurant. And you do not understand how much time a medium well steak will take to cook.

Nevertheless, I would never want our guests to leave disappointed. If there‚Äôs any arrangement I can make for you - if there‚Äôs any other way I can help you; you can send me a message on Instagram and I‚Äôd be more than willing to have you give us another go.

Hilton Singapore Orchard,"Subject: Feedback on Catering Quality ‚Äì Company D&D, 15 August 2025

Dear Hilton Singapore Orchard Team,

I recently attended my company D&D at your hotel recently. Unfortunately, I found the catering experience to be well below the standard I have come to expect from the Hilton brand.

Specifically:

Dishes lacked flavor and freshness. Food was tasteless.

Temperature control was poor ‚Äî some hot items were lukewarm on arrival.

Presentation felt rushed and unappealing for a venue of Hilton‚Äôs calibre.

I understand that banquet service has different logistics from restaurant dining, but even within those constraints, the quality on this occasion was disappointing. Given Hilton‚Äôs strong reputation, I was expecting a higher standard.

I hope this feedback will be shared with your banquet kitchen and event management teams so that future guests enjoy a dining experience that truly reflects the Hilton brand promise.

We used to staycay here when it was formerly known as Mandarin/Meritus Mandarin/Mandarin Orchard. We had wonderful memories during our stays back then. I was looking forward to an enjoyable birthday weekend, but we left feeling decidedly disappointed. The service was far below expectations. This is not the standard expected of Hilton. Despite noting a birthday celebration in my initial booking, plus another mention during check-in, we did not receive anything. They even removed the cake (that I bought) from our room because the check-in staff forgot about my request for 2pm check-out (we were dining at Estate). I even confirmed the late check-out before heading up to the room. Absolutely horrendous. There are better hotels out there like Marriott and Pan Pac.

Gleneagles Hospital,"Premium hospital, substandard service

I wish to express my deep disappointment with the service standards at Gleneagles Hospital, following my admission experience earlier this week.

I arrived at 8:00am for admission and collected a queue number, only to find the queue completely stagnant. When I approached the counter staff, I was brushed off with ‚Äúwait a while‚Äù ‚Äî without explanation, updates, or communication. Eventually, after wasting much time, I was told to proceed to the Day Admission Ward at Level 7.

What followed was even worse. The staff at the ward counter literally tossed the admission letter at me and asked me to sign, with no guidance or courtesy. When I asked twice for clarification, I was given casual, dismissive gestures that turned out to be misleading. Even when I highlighted the mistake, the staff remained cold and indifferent. While a manager eventually came forward to apologise, there was no sincerity or accountability ‚Äî only a token gesture.

On top of that, the food served was shockingly inadequate for a hospital that positions itself as ‚Äúprestigious.‚Äù Breakfast consisted of plain porridge with tofu and peanuts, accompanied only by black coffee. Cold milk was provided only upon request. There was no fruit, no proper protein, and certainly no sign of a balanced or nutritious diet. For patients who are supposed to be recovering, such meals fall far short of basic expectations, and one must question if they even meet minimum hospital nutrition standards.

What shocked me further was the complete lack of follow-up. Until my discharge, I never once received a call or visit from Gleneagles‚Äô management. By contrast, hospitals such as KKH and Thomson respond almost immediately to patient complaints, often sending senior staff to check on patients personally. Gleneagles‚Äô silence reflected indifference, not care.

For a hospital that charges premium rates and brands itself as a top-tier institution, this experience was utterly disappointing. Patients come to Gleneagles expecting care, respect, professionalism, and proper recovery support ‚Äî but what I encountered was stagnation, disregard, and even nutritionally questionable food.

Gleneagles should remember: healing is not just about medicine, but also dignity, respect, and nourishment. Anything less is unacceptable.",False,False,"Dear CJ J,

Ngee Ann City,"Frustratingly Slow Lifts - A Persistent Problem at Ngee Ann City

Ngee Ann City boasts a fantastic selection of shops and dining options, making it a go-to destination in Singapore. However, a major pain point consistently detracts from the experience: the excruciatingly slow lifts serving the main shopping levels, which also unfortunately cater to the fitness club on level 8.

These are the core lifts you rely on to navigate the mall, yet waiting for one feels like a test of patience. The problem is particularly acute during peak hours when securing a spot in a lift becomes a battle. You can easily find yourself waiting several minutes, only to have a packed lift whiz past without stopping. This makes moving between floors incredibly frustrating and time-consuming.

This isn't a new complaint; the sluggishness of these particular lifts has been a known issue for a significant period. For a prominent shopping complex like Ngee Ann City, the inefficiency of its primary lift system is a major letdown. It creates unnecessary stress and inconvenience for shoppers, especially those with young children, seniors, or anyone who prefers not to use the escalators.

While the rest of Ngee Ann City offers a great experience, the lift situation desperately needs attention. Investing in an upgrade or a more efficient management system for these key lifts would significantly enhance visitor satisfaction. Until then, be prepared to factor in considerable waiting time when planning to move between floors.",False,True,,Shopping mall,0,1.0,not spam,bad,ChIJ_7pt85EZ2jERPfKpmuwrzys,https://maps.google.com/?cid=3156790159017112125&g_mp=Cilnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaE5lYXJieRAAGAQgAA,4.4,"shopping_mall, point_of_interest, establishment"

Mount Elizabeth Hospital,"I tried to fill a prescription for warfarin, to my surprise, the pharmacy attempted to dispense a bottle that was set to expire in just one month - and I was told this was the only bottle they had left!

For a hospital of this reputation, it is unacceptable to offer patients near expired medication, especially something as sensitive and essential as warfarin.  I expected a far higher standard of care and accountability.

The experience has caused me to lose trust in the pharmacy's quality control and inventory management.  Patients rely on hospital pharmacies for safe, up-to-date medications - not leftovers that are nearing expiration.

CDL and CBM Management Teams

Dear Mr. Kwek, Mr. Chiang, and respective teams,

I am writing to express my extreme frustration and disappointment at the blatant and ongoing safety hazard under your management at City Square Mall ""City Square Mall is a family-friendly mall ""

Despite repeated feedback to CBM workers, nothing has been done about the recycle bins placed directly in front of the lift buttons, blocking access for children entirely. This is not a minor issue‚Äîit is a clear and unacceptable failure of safety and accessibility.

Here is the reality you continue to ignore:

Children who are alone cannot access the lift buttons at all. They cannot reach over or around the bins, leaving them stranded without adult help.

This is especially outrageous right now, as the opposite lift buttons have been out of order this month, leaving residents, visitors and especially children with no accessible alternative.

Fire risk: In an emergency, these bins create a direct obstruction. Delays in accessing lift controls during a fire or smoke event can be deadly, especially for children that cannot reach the lift call buttons. It is unconscionable that you are tolerating anything that hinders rapid evacuation.

Evacuation risk: Any child alone is effectively trapped, reliant on strangers or staff to move a bin or operate the lift‚Äîan utterly unacceptable situation in any modern, so-called ‚Äúflagship‚Äù mall.

Universal access failure: This layout is discriminatory. It ignores not just children, but anyone with limited reach or mobility.

It is frankly absurd that CBM staff have been told about this multiple times and yet these bins remain in place. That is either gross incompetence or a clear statement that you simply do not care about the safety of your tenants and visitors.

City Square Mall is a CDL-branded property. Allowing this basic, glaring safety violation to continue is an embarrassment to your brand and a direct risk to your patrons.

I expect CDL and CBM to take IMMEDIATE, concrete action:

Remove or relocate the recycle bins so they do not obstruct any lift buttons‚Äîimmediately.

Fix the out-of-order opposite lift buttons without delay.

Conduct a thorough audit of all lift lobbies in the mall for similar hazards.

Implement permanent guidelines to prevent this kind of dangerous, thoughtless placement in the future.

Your residents and visitors should not have to beg for the absolute minimum standard of safety. I am demanding a prompt and detailed response explaining exactly how you will correct this hazard‚Äîand when.

PS.Cafe Harding Road,"Made a reservation for 12 pax, no waiting time. Food was okay. Was super taken aback that the manager himself the service is super bad and rude. Requested to add chairs only and not table. We came in a big group of more than 10 pax and, we are seating at a corner, we don't mind to squeeze a little more with the tables that we have. The manager reply was no, cannot, your 2 extra friends will have to join the queue and wait outside.
The thing is, we have already placed our orders and we don't mind squeezing a little more. The manager is not helpful at all. is he expecting to have a table and seat after all of us finish eating and perhaps seated at another table far away from us? We already don't mind squeezing together in the same table.

Good thing is that we approach another server to request for the same 2 chairs. And the server is quick to react and resolved our issue by taking another 2 chair from the outdoor seating for us.

We are only requesting for small issue of adding chair. Why a normal server can do it but not the manager himself?

The drinks cups were also full of dirty scratches for my whole group of more than 10 pax. I think it's also time to have a change in the utensils.

Being a high end restaurant, I think it is honestly not suitable to use cups that's full scratches and stains. It just lower down the level and overall experience.

I think you can consider to send your manager to some training to help improve his service provided. He is the main host/greeter at the front, and his attitude will leave a not pleasant first impression to the customer. I understand that the business good.

Immigration & Checkpoints Authority,"I called the ICA hotline today (20 June 2025) to check if I could collect my passport four days earlier than the scheduled date (24 June), from ICA HQ instead of Jurong SingPost. After explaining my situation, the officer on the phone kindly told me that I could head down to ICA HQ and that there was a possibility I might be able to collect it there.

I arrived at 12:00 PM and explained my case to the counter staff. The lady at the counter was polite and helpful. She said if the passport was in the building, I would definitely get a queue number, and told me to return before 4:00 PM or wait for a call.

At 3:26 PM, I got a call from an officer (unfortunately I didn‚Äôt get her name) informing me that the passport was actually at Jurong SingPost. I explained again that I needed the passport urgently as I am leaving on 22 June, and the official collection date is 24 June. She said I could go to Level 2 counter 23 and speak to an officer directly ‚Äî no need to queue.

I waited from 4:05 PM to 5:00 PM at Level 2 Counter 23. An elderly staff member spoke to me and said she would check. Then Officer Jirach came out and bluntly told me they couldn‚Äôt help and ""Even I would, it's wrong timing.""

What does ""Even I would, it's wrong timing."" even mean?

It was just past 5PM ‚Äî ICA was still open.

SingPost closes at 8PM.

I followed all the instructions I was given ‚Äî yet still received no assistance.

This is not just about a passport. It‚Äôs about time, money, and dignity.

I wasted my whole afternoon and travel costs just to be dismissed coldly by someone who didn‚Äôt even try to help. If the system was more consistent and transparent, or if officers had more compassion, this wouldn‚Äôt have happened.

Honestly, this kind of attitude can easily be replaced by a computer ‚Äî and it would probably do a better job, without the attitude.

I still want to thank the call centre staff and the initial counter lady ‚Äî they were respectful and tried to help.

A few weeks ago, I saw a woman almost fall down the escalator because she was going in the opposite direction of the escalator direction.

Yes, a sign just like the one in the picture was put up, but she was in a hurry and walked right past it and onto the escalator.

I too, had missed the sign and was about to follow her until her stumble jolted me.

I later alerted the station staff about the low visibility of the sign, and he responded the sign was already put up but she didn‚Äôt see it (insinuating the fault was hers alone).

I suggested placing blinking hazard lights, and it appeared as if he was going to add them.

Today, the escalator direction was reversed again and there is the same sign, without any improvements for visibility.

People coming into any train station can be in a hurry and move quickly by habit. When escalator directions are reversed, signs are m extremely important for safety‚Äôs sake. - and the MRT staff needs to be mindful that the consequence for people missing the sign, can be potentially fatal.

Lucky Plaza,"This review is about this food stall inside lucky plaza.

I recently visited this food stall in the basement of Lucky Plaza and was disappointed with my experience, particularly regarding their pricing and customer service. The food stall has prices clearly posted on the wall, which I expected to be honored.

I ordered two vegetables and one fish, with a posted price of $7.00. However, when I went to pay, the cashier attempted to charge me $8.40. Confused, I asked why, but instead of receiving an explanation, the cashier started speaking loudly in Mandarin. My friend, who ordered right after me, got two meats and one vegetable was charged exactly what was posted‚Äî$5.60.

When I questioned the price difference, the cashier spoke in Mandarin to my friend, who told her he didn‚Äôt understand. She then turned to another worker, who also spoke Mandarin but struggled with English. At no point did I receive a clear explanation, and I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was being overcharged for no reason.

The lack of transparency and poor communication left a bad impression. Whether it was a mistake or something else, the situation made me feel like I was being cheated.

Lucky Plaza,"I visited Shenton 2000 Exchange at Lucky Plaza (opposite Jollibee) on 19th July as I was preparing for an upcoming trip to the Philippines. After comparing a few places nearby, I chose this stall because their rate seemed slightly better ‚Äî I was quoted 43.10 PHP for 1 SGD.

I handed over \$300 SGD, and the clerk gave me 13,000 PHP. He then said he had no smaller change for the exact expected amount of 12,930 PHP, and that I had to top up \$12 SGD via PayNow to his personal number. At the time, I didn‚Äôt think much of it and went along.

However, he did not provide any receipt for the transaction. When I did the math later, I realized the numbers didn‚Äôt add up, and I had clearly overpaid for the 70 PHP extra. I returned to the stall within a few minutes and pointed out the discrepancy. Initially, he refunded me \$2.50, but only after more back and forth and visible hesitation did he refund the remaining \$8, for a total of \$10.50 SGD returned.

I‚Äôve reflected on the experience, and several things felt off:

* Why was there no receipt given?
* Why was the top-up made to a personal number?
* And why did he only correct the refund after pressure?

Looking at recent reviews, I also noticed someone else mentioned being shortchanged at this same stall a few months ago ‚Äî which makes this feel more deliberate than accidental.

City Gate,"Add-on on 23 June 2025:
Please do something about the cockroach infestation. I used the toilet at level 2 last Saturday and the toilet paper rolled out with a medium cockroach! Just imagine using toilet paper to clean yourself, only to further dirty yourself with cockroach-contaminated toilet paper.

Also, a few weeks ago, when I was using the tap, instead of water flowing out, a cockroach flowed out with the water from the tap.

There are cockroaches everywhere, in the toilets and also along the corridors of the stores. Read my previous review, one of the stores had cockroach going into the seat too.

PLEASE, FOR THE SAFETY FOR EVERYONE, DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE COCKROACH INFESTATION ISSUE!

-----------------------------------------------------

I frequent this mall for its variety of food but recently I noticed there's a cockroach infestation problem that is getting worse.

There are cockroaches in the corridor between the shops and toilets at night. Two days ago, I saw a medium cockroach crawl into the gap of my seat at an eatery at level 2 and last night there was a medium cockroach on one of the two benches beside the escalator at level 2. Please look into the cockroach infestation issue and take action such as calling for pest control as I now hesitate to eat at City Gate because I keep seeing cockroaches. Best to take action before mass food contamination takes place and before the cockroaches multiply until the situation gets out of hand.

In addition, please do something about the ventilation in the mall as strong cigarette smoke can be smelt at the area from the escalator to the toilets at Level 2. This will cause health issues for both consumers and shop staff in the long run. It will be ideal to enforce non-smoking laws as I have witnessed men holding lit cigarettes walking through the mall, the bad habit probably inherited from the neighbouring Sultan Plaza which is also contaminated with cigarette smoke despite being air-conditioned.

I also assumed it was okay to consume my light meal since Luckin' Coffee is nearby, giving off a carefree vibe.

While I was munching on my toast, I made sure not to drop any crumbs. Then, I saw a woman who appeared to be a cleaner, based on her attire, pointing her phone at me and taking a photo. As she took my picture, I looked up and glared at her. She then turned around and pretended to take photos on the other side. Such pretense! I found this very rude. Why do we have to act this way?

No Signboard Seafood At Geylang,"We ordered king crab and lobster. Before serving, the staff showed us the fresh seafood for inspection and photos, but when the dishes arrived, the lobster and king crab shells were different from what we had photographed earlier. The staff denied any seafood substitution, but the lobster meat wasn't fresh, and the king crab shell also did not match the one we photographed before. I have saved all detailed photos and marked the contrasting areas.
1. The left antenna of the lobster was shortened when served. If it was for cooking convenience, why only shorten the left antenna and not the right?
2. After serving, the red leg of the lobster on the pic was intact, but it fell off later so I have drawn it back in the photo. However, the left half of the lobster had four long legs plus one short front leg, whereas in the photos of the raw lobster, apart from the four legs on each side, there was clearly two front legs on each side that are equally long.

The explanation from the staff later was that indeed one leg fell off and was in the trash bin, as two lobsters were chopped together with another lobster from another table. If it was ours, it should have fallen off in place number 3. However, the short front leg on the left half of the lobster could be considered as not being visible in the abdomen, but the short front leg of the lobster on the right half was not in the dish, with only four legs plus one long front leg, which is very confusing.

The staff‚Äôs explanation for the lobster is that it was because the new chef was not careful enough when chopping the lobster, and said that she would reflect to the boss and also apologized. However, passing the buck to new staff has long been a very typical excuse in public relations situations.

Regarding the king crab, the crab meat indeed tastes more fresh, but the shell was different from the live photo we took.
1. In position 1 of the live crab shell photo, there were two columns of bracket-shaped spikes, but the dish crab shell had two rows of straight spikes.
2. At position 2, the spikes were almost parallel to the spikes on the right on live crab shell, but spike number 2 on the dish crab shell was located to the left and slightly below the spikes on the right.
3. Spike number 3 in the live crab shell photo was positioned diagonally below the spike above it, whereas spike number 3 on the dish crab shell was directly below the spike above it.
4. In the live photo, spike number 4 consisted of two adjacent spikes, but on the dish, spike number 4 has only one single spike. This is the most straightforward and undeniable evidence.

However, even upon repeated questioning, the staff never admits the seafood substitution and is adamant that the seafood we had is the ones we have taken pics for.

- The noise from the military jets is unbearable. They are 10x louder than normal airplanes. The jets fly on weekdays and Saturdays, starting from 8am to 9pm.

Holiday Inn Express Singapore Katong by IHG,"Disappointing Check-in Experience ‚Äì Rigid ID Policy Left Me Without a Room

I had a very frustrating experience at Holiday Inn Express Singapore Katong today. Upon arrival, I was told that I must present a physical ID to check in ‚Äì neither my digital SingPass ID nor a photo of my ID was accepted. This was extremely inconvenient and surprising, especially in Singapore where digital identity is widely recognized, even for official purposes.

The front desk staff claimed this was a rule set by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and that there was absolutely nothing they could do. I find this hard to believe, as other hotels in Singapore have accepted digital IDs without issue. There was no attempt to problem-solve or offer any alternative.

In the end, I couldn‚Äôt check in at all and had no choice but to leave the hotel. This was an incredibly disappointing experience ‚Äì not just because of the rigid and outdated policy, but also the complete lack of flexibility or empathy from the staff.

If this is truly a hotel policy, it should be made very clear at the time of booking, especially for local guests who may not carry their physical ID. For a major international brand, I expected better.

Holiday Inn Express Katong should urgently review this check-in policy and consider how it affects guest experience in today‚Äôs digital-first world.",False,False,"Dear E,

Greetings from Holiday Inn Express Singapore Katong!

Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience at Holiday Inn Express Singapore Katong. We sincerely regret the inconvenience and frustration you encountered during your check-in attempt, and we appreciate the opportunity to clarify the situation.

We understand your concern and acknowledge how important it is for today‚Äôs travelers to enjoy seamless, digitally supported experiences. While Singpass is widely accepted across many government and commercial services in Singapore, please allow us to clarify that hotel check-ins still require a physical identity card (NRIC or long-term pass) under the National Registration Regulations, which is overseen by the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA).

Although digital ICs via Singpass have been officially accepted for many government agency services since 1 November 2021, hotel check-ins remain one of the few exceptions where physical ID is still legally required. This regulatory requirement is currently under review, but until such changes are formally enacted, hotels across Singapore are obligated to comply with this legislation.

We truly empathize with the inconvenience this caused you and regret that we were unable to offer flexibility due to these national requirements. We also take your suggestion seriously ‚Äî clearer communication about ID requirements at the time of booking is something we are actively reviewing to help prevent similar situations for future guests.

Once again, we are truly sorry for the disappointment this caused and hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back under better circumstances.

Should you need further clarification or assistance, please feel free to contact us directly at info.sinka@ihg.com.

As for the chili crab, I can easily make it at home‚Äîit‚Äôs simple and hard to mess up. However, Jumbo‚Äôs chili crab was just very mediocre, nothing special. The fried rice was also disappointing; any random eatery, or even the fried rice I cook at home, tastes better than Jumbo‚Äôs.
The bamboo clams were sold per piece, and we ordered four. The meat was tough, chewy, and not tasty at all.
Most importantly‚Äîthe Australian lobster! It was cooked terribly! so bad that I have to use the word ‚Äúinedible‚Äù to describe it! Australian lobster has great meat quality, but they managed to ruin it completely. What a waste of my lobster!
When seafood is fresh, simply boiling it would already make it delicious, but somehow, this famous seafood restaurant made it taste so bad!
Honestly, I don‚Äôt understand how such a well-known seafood restaurant can serve food that tastes worse than the zichar stall downstairs from my home.
The restaurant was very crowded, and the tables were packed closely together, so the dining environment was just average. The servers were busy, and when we were unsure of what flavors to order, they couldn‚Äôt provide much help.
All in all, I will never go to Jumbo again!",False,False,We appreciate you taking the time to share such a detailed review about your recent experience.

Parkway East Hospital,"Worst ever experience in the A&E department regarding the billing issue and make it so hard for a patient to left with no choice to walk out from the hospital and the dr and nurse need to run the drip faster and stop all the blood test .  Due to the PATIENT ACCOUNT OFFICE  can‚Äôt get hold of the insurance company to issue LOG and insist that without LOG need to go out and pay as outpatient . Reason being is tomorrow is public holiday ! Well done ! Awesome lady which scared the insurance company don‚Äôt want to make payment , and pushing the patient to go off as outpatient . She can just stand there and insist that cannot go for admission since the insurance company did not take the call for emergency LOG request . She can stand beside and just say how ? No LOG what is your  plan next , you wanna pay the full amount or you just stop treatment and pay as outpatient ? With no empathy at all!

Kudos to the patient account office staff name :

We found a live one, caught it, and brought it to the hotel staff. Their reaction was honestly underwhelming. They claimed they will inform housekeeping to do an inspection but anyone who has dealt with bed bugs before knows that just cleaning in itself is woefully insufficient. After plenty of back and forth between the platform, the hotel, and us, they claimed they requested pest control inspection but were ultimately ‚Äúunable‚Äù to share the proof of this inspection with us. I suppose to be fair I should mention they were kind enough to refund us one night‚Äôs stay (minus taxes and service fees that they deducted from the refund) out of five - how generous!

When my partner and I arrived at the hotel at around 4pm on Monday 18/8, we were greeted in an oddly offhand manner by a female receptionist who took around 10 mins assigning us a room, saying that none of the rooms had been cleaned yet.  We thought this was a bit strange, but we finally got assigned a room. However, when got to the room, we found that she had given us a twin room without telling us, even though we had booked a king room. When we went back to reception to question this, she rather rudely handed us off to another colleague without any apology for her actions at all.

Village Hotel Katong,"Carpark coupon did not work with 3 cars behind us, probably eager to leave as we were. We had to turn around and head back to the reception. This was obviously bloody inconvenient. He comes back mad saying that the coupon was a one-time use only and we had to pay S$14+.Pissed at this point, went in and asked for the duty manager.I thought nothing would shock me anymore but was told that the duty manager was in a meeting and if we needed to see the duty manager then we had to wait! Suddenly, the tables turned and she issues us a coupon. I am absolutely ashamed to have chosen this hotel as a gift for my his birthday and apologized all the way back home. Room was ok but bad service & Terrible breakfast. There are many hotels a stone's throw away if you choose this vicinity such Indigo, Holiday Inn, Grand Mercure or even Santa Grand. I haven't stayed in these properties but I doubt they'd be as horrific. Otherwise, PLENTY of options outside this vicinity within this price range! Try the breakfast at the Amara at Tanjong Pagar for example. That's what you call bang for your buck.
I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. Good thing we did not pay an exorbitant price as we booked on Trip.com via Skyscanner for S$230 nett. Still, a complete waste of money and if you really value your time, it's time better spent elsewhere for people as busy as us.

Keppel Club,"Responding to Keppel Club‚Äôs updated comment below.

Imagine you have paid the joining fees and monthly subscription fees, and the Club says ""Sorry you cannot book the tennis facility because we have leased it out to a tennis academy.""

Keppel Club has 2 tennis courts and have signed a multi-year contract to lease out the courts to Vamos Tennis Academy. The Club has blocked out peak hours for both courts on weekdays and weekends on their online booking website.

The response from Keppel Club is a clear misrepresentation. It is false that ""one of them is always available for members to book"". There is written documentation proof to back this up.

Importantly, Keppel Club has stated that the purpose is to ""build the tennis community through lessons, junior development and supporting club games"".

As a member, we should ask 5 key questions :

1. Why continue to charge us monthly fees if we are unable to use the club facilities?
2. Is it more profitable to lease out the tennis courts to a tennis academy?
3. Was there a transparent process on the selection of Vamos Tennis Academy?
4. How much is Keppel Club earning per month from this arrangement with Vamos?
5. Did the Club have to resort to this approach to increase its financials? What are we missing here?

Why stop at tennis? Why not lease out the golf course to a golf academy and might also boost its financial returns?

If we look at other club's approach, a similar club in the East has 3 tennis courts and have a tennis academy as well. But they have a clear policy that one tennis court will always be available to members to book. This could be a balanced approach that Keppel should be implementing and not falsely claiming it in their response.

I hope that Keppel Club will at least communicate with the members on this corporate action. It will be a bonus if the Club engages the members to share their views.",False,False,"It is not correct that Keppel Club does not allow members to book the tennis courts. The Club has two courts. One of them is always available for members to book. And if there is no class, the other courts will also be made available for members to book.

Guthrie House,"I had the most unpleasant, inhumane experience with the Senior Property Manager, Charles Quek today. One week ago, on 30 Jan at 7.55pm, I tripped and had a bad fall outside Cold Storage due to uneven tiles on the driveway while walking home after making my purchase. I fell forward and all my grocery spilled on the pavement. A young gentleman passed by and all he could manage was asked ""Are you Ok?""  and walked away. My left knee was bleeding and hurting and my left elbow was also bleeding when I used my left elbow to break the fall. I trudged home 400 km away grittting my teeth till I reached home. I iced down the brusied knee. It was so painful I could barely walk. I rested and applied whatever left over antiseptic cream I could find in my home first aid box while jugggling with caring for my husband. Today, I went to Cold Storage around 8.45am to report the incident to the security guard at the counter. I brought him outside to show him where the uneven tiles were and told him to do something before someone else trip and fall, maybe a worse fall than mine. He took down my contact number and said that he will inform Charles to call me by today. Charles called me at 11am and apologised for the incident. He wanted to end the call until I said that the management Guthrie House should be responsible for my fall. He then asked me to see the doctor and send the invoice to him. I saw the doctor at Advantage Medical Clinic at 2pm and whatsapp and emailed the invoice to Charles. As there were no reponse from him, I went to his office to give him the invoice. I asked him how is he going to pay me. All he said was asked me to wait
outside while he took the invoice and went inside his office. He paid me $84.20 in cash. I showed him my bruised knee and he dared said that it was a small fall. On my way home, I saw that the management still did nothing to the uneven tiles. Such narcisstic people reflects the lousy management of this building.

Hwa Chong International School,"Some teachers cannot even speak basic English properly, and I don‚Äôt mean the Mother Tongue teachers. How will they teach if they can‚Äôt even write grammatically correct sentences? I seriously think some of the teachers here have no idea what they‚Äôre doing.

Facilities are HORRIBLE. Everything is old and of poor quality. Compared to the amount of tuition that I pay this school, the facilities are so worn and cheap.
School food is horrible, either overcooked or undercooked. Doesn‚Äôt even taste good. The main building canteen is not much better.

Boarding is the absolute worst. Rooms have a serious pest problem that the school REFUSES to do anything about, mentors blatantly favor some boarders over others, and give them different treatment. They always treat Chinese boarders better than foreign boarders, and every boarding activity accommodates to them. Mandatory to watch a Chinese movie with no subtitles? What a joke.
Even the announcements made by boarding council members are in Chinese. Do you expect foreigners to translate everything you say on the spot?

Mentors make the boarding experience much more difficult... speaking in a rude tone to boarders, saying things that are completely out of line / inappropriate, etc. I don‚Äôt even know where the school is finding these people from. Irresponsible, lazy, ignorant individuals.

Boarding food is trash. Not just me, but my friends report hair, plastic, eggshells being found in the food. They say they are working on it, they say they‚Äôll report it, they say say say and never do. Are you trying to poison your boarders?

Aloft Singapore Novena,"Worst Hotel Experience ‚Äì Feels Like a Scam

I have no idea how Aloft Novena dares to charge these prices for what they provide. The rooms are TINY ‚Äî not ‚Äúcompact‚Äù or ‚Äúcozy‚Äù tiny, but claustrophobic box tiny. There‚Äôs not even space to properly open and keep luggage bags ‚Äî you literally have to step over them to move around.

There‚Äôs no air-conditioning in the corridors, so every time you step out of your room, you‚Äôre hit with a wave of heat. But the real insult? The room AC is controlled by the hotel ‚Äî not by guests who actually paid to stay there. They turn it off or choke the airflow at night to save on electricity. I woke up drenched in sweat at 6 am, called reception, and magically the AC was ‚Äúworking‚Äù again within five minutes. Translation: they were cutting it on purpose.

Temperature is locked at 21¬∞C, and if you dare to ask them to make it cooler, it becomes some ridiculous drama. This same thing happened my first night, but I let it go. Second night I complained, and suddenly I‚Äôm offered free breakfast ‚Äî clearly a bribe so I don‚Äôt post an honest review.

Housekeeping is equally unprofessional. The moment you call for anything, they come and slam the doorbell repeatedly without even considering that a guest could be in the washroom or resting.

Instead, he redirected me to use the ticketing machine, and pressed top up $50 value, when i asked for concession. He did not seem to understand or bothered about the process at all and just told me to top up cash via the machine.

Luckily, I realised in time and managed to reverse the transaction. otherwise, the funds would have gone into general stored value instead of the intended train concession. This lack of basic knowledge and poor service is extremely disappointing, especially for something so simple. Please ensure your staff are properly trained.

Swiss Club Singapore,"Arbenz - food quality has collapsed

Arbenz is the fine dining restaurant at The Swiss Club. The excellent food and ambience was what endeared itself to many patrons. But recent major staff changes, where departures in both the kitchen (main chef and his deputy) and front office staff, resulted in a much less desirable experience on a visit yesterday (3rd May).

Mainly, the quality/standard of the food has fallen off a cliff.
The beef, which was always beautifully done, was basically tasteless and unevenly cooked. The salad was devoid of any dressing. Portions of sides were way smaller that it used to be.

It is my hope that Arbenz can sort out their teething issues resulting from this staff turnover. Foremost that needs fixing is the standard of the food/cooking.

Sri Vairavimada Kaliamman Temple,"Feedback Regarding Accessibility Challenges at the Temple

To Temple Management

I am writing this feedback to bring to your attention a concern regarding the accessibility of the temple for elderly or physically challenged devotees.

Last Thursday, I visited the temple with my friend‚Äôs 83-year-old mother, who is wheelchair-bound, for her prayers in memory of her recently deceased son. While we greatly appreciate the opportunity to seek solace and spiritual comfort, we encountered significant difficulty accessing the main sanctum.

The ramp leading to the temple was extremely steep, to the point that it required six people to assist in pushing the wheelchair. This posed not only a logistical challenge but also a safety risk, as the steepness made it very difficult to control the wheelchair.

I humbly suggest that the temple management considers reviewing the current infrastructure and possibly making the necessary adjustments to improve accessibility, especially for those who are elderly or physically challenged. A gentler slope or alternative solutions could ensure that all devotees can visit the temple safely and without undue hardship.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that with your continued efforts, the temple will remain a welcoming and inclusive space for all.",False,True,,Hindu temple,0,1.0,not spam,bad,ChIJM0dPiHoX2jERDPDUgWihvCM,https://maps.google.com/?cid=2575110557175967756&g_mp=Cilnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaE5lYXJieRAAGAQgAA,4.8,"hindu_temple, place_of_worship, point_of_interest, establishment"

CDC Driving Centre (Ubi),"I would like to share my experience in obtaining my Class 2B license, which spanned a period of six months. While I have encountered a few patient and helpful instructors, I have also faced situations where some instructors were unreasonably rude in their approach to teaching.

It often felt as though certain instructors expected students to grasp the skills immediately, and would scold us for falling or for being slower to pick things up. I find this mindset difficult to understand, as students are paying for guidance, support, and instruction not for discouragement. Learning to ride is a process, and mistakes, including falls, are part of that process. I would also like to emphasise that whether a student is on their sixth lesson or their first, they remain a learner. The very reason we are here is because we have not yet mastered the skill and are still in the process of learning. There is no need for condescending remarks. It is reasonable to expect learners not to repeat mistakes they have already been taught to avoid, but that does not justify making discouraging remarks.

Unfortunately, I found that poor explanations, coupled with dismissive attitudes, made learning more challenging. I am not paying you to get your snarky comments and attitude. If you don‚Äôt have the patience to teach kindly do not be an instructor and make it hard for the learners. Please stop trying to show your ‚Äúauthority‚Äù to us learners when we came here to learn.

I would also like to note that this does not apply to all instructors, as I have experienced both ends of the spectrum. However, my experience has been skewed towards the less respectful ones. Additionally, I could not help but notice that in some cases, instructors seemed more attentive to learners of their own race, which I believe is unfair and unprofessional.",False,False,,Driving school,0,1.0,not spam,bad,ChIJN409H-AX2jERUGjku0klD2g,https://maps.google.com/?cid=7498252903210313808&g_mp=Cilnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaE5lYXJieRAAGAQgAA,3.8,"point_of_interest, establishment"

The Woodleigh Mall,"Review for Ten Points Porridge
Rating: 1/10

I had a very disappointing experience at Ten Points Porridge. The porridge was served only warm, not hot, which made it unappetizing. The texture was dry instead of smooth and comforting, and it lacked any real flavor‚Äîcompletely tasteless.

To make things worse, the egg was barely cooked, practically raw, and just sat there without blending into the porridge properly. It felt like no effort was put into making the dish enjoyable.

Overall, this was one of the worst porridge experiences I‚Äôve had. If you‚Äôre looking for a warm, flavorful bowl of porridge, this is definitely not the place to go.

ComfortDelGro Driving Centre,"I would like to express my dissatisfaction with a recent learning experience in the Elite team program. I enrolled in this class with the clear expectation of studying under a specific main instructor, whose teaching I value highly and for whom I was willing to pay an additional fee. However, during a recent session when the main instructor was on leave, a substitute teacher from another team was assigned. Unfortunately, I found this substitute instructor to be unengaged and seemingly unwilling to share their knowledge fully, which gave the impression that they were intentionally withholding skills from students outside their team.

I paid a total of $98.1 for this session, and I genuinely feel that the experience did not reflect the value of that investment.

Therefore, I respectfully request that CDC allow Elite learners the option to cancel or reschedule a session without penalty in cases where their designated main instructor is unavailable. Learners choose and pay for a specific instructor, and it is not fair that their payment is arbitrarily allocated to a substitute they did not select.

Both the lap pool and the main pool. BBQs are very hard to book for weekends because the condo is so crowded. Yes it looks good from the outside but once you start living here, you realise how noisy and crowded it is. The last big issue is how poorly constructed the units were: the materials are cheap and problems started showing after the condo reached 2 years (2016): pipes leaking in bathrooms and showers, electrical issues, walls taking mold and having cracks appear quicker despite new paint, etc. (Happened in my unit in block 10A but also some of my neighbors block 6A, 12C and 14). If you find a unit to rent that's been well maintained, make sure to check all this, and if you have kids this condo can work for you. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. Note the shuttle service between the condo and the MRT has been discontinued by the management. It's a 15min walk with kids to the MRT/Nex, or $6-$10 by Grab or Taxi.

And they said they check everything is in order before returning car to me. Besides this, they fixed lousy reverse sensors, and lousy gas struts arm that couldn‚Äôt hold the boot door.

AutoBay@Kaki Bukit,"Recently my car developed two issues.

The left headlight (HID) blew.

The plastic exterior handle of my boot locking mechanism was damaged. But the locking mechanism with the attached rear view camera were working fine.

I was recommended to go to Kai Liang Motor Service (1 Kaki Bukit Avenue 6 #01-101 Autobay @ Kaki Bukit S(417883). Gave them a call and brought my car down to them.

The mechanic took some photos of the components related to the left headlight that blew.

They also visually inspected the damaged plastic exterior handle of the boot locking mechanism. They did not open the inside cover of the boot door to inspect the boot locking mechanism. They confirmed that the locking mechanism itself and attached rear view camera were working fine.

Since I was rushing off to another appointment, I asked them to give me a quote via WhatsApp.

They informed me that both front headlights have to change because headlights are supplied as a pair. They also said the ballast of each headlight have to change.

They quoted:
Two bulbs $230
Original Ballast $450
OEM Ballast $320
Labour $120

For the damaged plastic exterior of boot lock, they quoted $95.

I found another car repair shop that changed the one headlight (0EM) for $150. No need to change both headlights. No need to change ballast.

Just to give them the benefit of a doubt, I asked Kai Liang if they are ok to just change the plastic exterior handle of the lock. They said ok. I fixed an appointment with them.

When I reached the shop, the boss told me they have to re-inspect the damaged plastic exterior lock again.

They proceeded to pull open the inside cover of the boot door to get to the locking mechanism. They took it out and informed me that the plastic exterior handle, the locking mechanism and the camera comes as a set. So have to change all three together.

I asked them why during the first inspection they told me that changing the plastic exterior handle of the lock was good enough? The boss said they did not open up the inside of the boot door the first time. So they couldn‚Äôt be sure. If they were not sure, why even quote the plastic exterior handle of the lock?

The boss insisted the exterior plastic handle, the locking mechanism and the camera must be changed together. He will get a quote. By this time, I have lost my trust in them. I told them to put everything back into the boot door. The boss told me that he has to charge me $30 for the labour done. I had enough.

I paid the $30 and left.

If they had diagnose the problem wrongly the first time. And I have to go down to the shop a second time for them to inspect again, they really should not be in the car repair business.

If they want to make some extra profit, the way they went about it is really undignified for any business.
